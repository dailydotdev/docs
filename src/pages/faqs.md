    <summary>How to get featured / get your post picked up by daily.dev?</summary>
        <p>There are 2 ways that posts appear in the daily.dev feed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first is that we source it from one of the 600+ sites that we gather posts from.</li>
        <li>The second is via submissions from the community via <a href="/docs/key-features/community-picks">Community Picks.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We therefore recommend you publish your posts on well known developer related publications.</p>
        <p>Bear in mind that this does not guarantee that your post will get picked up, but it will greatly increase your chances!</p>

        <p>Blocking is only applied to posts that are displayed on the <strong>"My Feed"</strong> feed</p>
        <p>Blocking a tag does not affect the content on the "Popular", "Most Upvoted" and "Best Discussions" feeds.</p>
        <p>These feeds will still show posts with tags that you have blocked.</p>

    <summary>My weekly reading goals are reseting / not updating?</summary>
        <p>Our weekly reading goals run from Monday to Sunday.</p>
        <p><strong>At midnight (GMT) your weekly reading goal progress is reset</strong>, and you start again.</p>
        <p>Whatever rank you achieved the week before will be shown and you will see progress indicators towards repeating it.</p>
        <p>Bear in mind that we only count 1 post each day towards your reading goal, so even if you read 100 posts one day and then 0 the next day, you will only get 1 day counted towards your weekly reading goal.</p>
