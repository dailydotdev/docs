# Build Notes

## Known Issues

### SSR Build Issue (Phase 3)
- The production build currently fails due to React import issues after dependency updates
- Development server works correctly (`npm start`)
- Issue appears to be related to `npm audit fix` dependency updates affecting SSR
- Error: "ReferenceError: React is not defined at TitleFormatterProvider"
- This is a Docusaurus framework-level issue, not related to our custom code

### Workaround
- Development and testing should use `npm start`
- Production builds may need dependency rollback or framework update
- All Phase 3 features are functional in development mode

### Resolution Required
- Investigate specific dependency causing SSR issues
- Consider Docusaurus version update
- Alternative: selective dependency rollback
