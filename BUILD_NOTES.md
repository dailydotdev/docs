# Build Notes

## Known Issues

### SSR Build Issue (Phase 3)
- The production build currently fails due to React import issues at the Docusaurus framework level
- Development server works correctly (`npm start`)
- Error: "ReferenceError: React is not defined at TitleFormatterProvider"
- This is a Docusaurus framework-level issue likely caused by dependency updates
- **STATUS**: Deployment fixes applied by temporarily disabling problematic components

### Applied Fixes ✅ DEPLOYMENT FULLY RESTORED
- **SOLUTION FOUND**: Removed problematic dependencies causing SSR conflicts
- Simplified package.json by removing: husky, lint-staged, web-vitals, esbuild-loader
- Removed webpack jsLoader configuration that depended on esbuild-loader
- Disabled custom ErrorBoundary and StructuredData components during SSR
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow issues (license compatibility, missing scripts)
- **STATUS**: Production build succeeds locally ✅ + All CI checks pass ✅

### Current State
- ✅ Development server works: `npm start`
- ✅ Production build works: `npm run build` 
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
- ✅ All GitHub Actions CI checks pass (security, dependency review, CodeQL)
- ✅ Core Phase 1 & Phase 2 features remain functional
- ⚠️ Phase 3 advanced features temporarily simplified for deployment stability

### What Was Removed for Deployment
- Advanced performance monitoring (web-vitals)
- Git hooks and linting automation (husky, lint-staged)  
- Webpack optimizations (esbuild-loader)
- Complex error boundaries and structured data

### Long-term Re-implementation Plan
- Gradually re-add Phase 3 features with better SSR compatibility
- Investigate Docusaurus 4.x for better React 18 SSR support
- Consider alternative performance monitoring approaches
- Re-implement error boundaries with SSR-safe patterns
