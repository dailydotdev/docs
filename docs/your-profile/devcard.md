# DevCard 

## Show Off Your daily.dev Activity!

The DevCard displays your daily.dev activity and statistics, including the number of posts you've read, your reputation points, the sources and tags you follow, and Squads you've joined. You can generate your own DevCard, customize it, and share your activity with your network using the hashtag #DevCard.
