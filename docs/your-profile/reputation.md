# Reputation Explained  

## What is Reputation?  

Reputation is a metric that reflects the trust you earn from the community through positive and meaningful interactions. It's a measure of your contributions' impact, visible on your profile. Higher reputation unlocks more privileges, reflecting your role in shaping our community.  

Starting in 2025, **higher reputation increases your content's visibility**. Posts and comments from high-reputation users receive priority in ranking algorithms.

## Reputation Basics  

When you sign up for daily.dev, you start with **10 points**, celebrating your entry into the community. Reputation never falls below **0**, preventing negative scores.  

Reputation is visible across the platform:  

- **On the app's header**: See your reputation near your profile image.  
- **On your comments and posts**: Reputation is highlighted on your interactions.  
- **On your public profile page**: Showcases your overall reputation.  
- **On your DevCard**: Reputation is also displayed on your personalized DevCard.  

## How to Earn Reputation Points  

:::info  
Reputation points are granted only when actions such as upvotes, downvotes, or other contributions come from users with **250 or more reputation points**. For example, if a user with less than 250 reputation points upvotes your post or comment, it will not affect your reputation score. This ensures that reputation reflects feedback from established members of the community.  
:::  

Reputation points are gained or lost through specific actions, fostering accountability:  

| Activity                             | Points  |  
|--------------------------------------|---------|  
| Post upvoted                         | **+10** |  
| Post downvoted                       | **-10** |  
| Post banned or removed               | **-100**|  
| Comment upvoted                      | **+50** |  
| Comment downvoted                    | **-50** |  
| Report results in post removal       | **+100**|  
| Approved source suggestion           | **+200**|
