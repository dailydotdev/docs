# Reputation Explained

## What is Reputation?

Reputation is a metric that reflects the trust you earn from the community through positive and meaningful interactions. It's a measure of your contributions' impact, visible on your profile. Higher reputation unlocks more privileges, reflecting your role in shaping our community.

## Reputation Basics

When you sign up for daily.dev, you start with **10 points**, celebrating your entry into the community. Reputation never falls below **0**, preventing negative scores.
