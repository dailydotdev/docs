## How to Earn a Top Reader Badge

Here's how you can become a Top Reader:

1. **Read consistently**: Spend time engaging with posts in specific content categories. Categories
   with higher engagement across the platform are eligible for the Top Reader badge.
2. **Monthly evaluation**: Every month, daily.dev evaluates reading days for each category. Based on
   engagement, certain high-activity tags are "whitelisted" for badge eligibility.
3. **Notification**: If you're among the top readers for a category, you’ll receive both an in-app
   notification and an email letting you know you’ve earned the Top Reader badge.
4. **Display on profile**: Once awarded, your badge will display on your profile, showcasing the
   number of times you've earned this recognition and the specific categories where you excel.

## Badge Frequency and Display

- **Monthly updates**: Badges are awarded each month based on the previous month’s activity. Stay
  consistent to earn badges across multiple categories!
- **Profile display**: Your Top Reader badge will show on your profile page, highlighting the number
  of times you've earned it and the categories associated with your achievements.
- **Badge download**: Download your badge from the in-app notification to share your accomplishment
  outside of daily.dev.

## Troubleshooting

If your badge isn’t displaying correctly or if you don’t receive a notification after significant
activity in a category:

- Verify your reading days and make sure you’re engaging consistently in high-activity categories.
- Refresh your profile page after receiving the in-app notification.
