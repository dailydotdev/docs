## Prerequisites

To get a verified company badge, you need access to your work email. Make sure you can receive emails at this address, as you’ll need to verify it during the process.

## Benefits of the Verified Company Badge

- Showcase your professional affiliation directly on your profile.
- Build credibility by displaying a verified badge that confirms your employment.
- Stand out in discussions with a badge that appears next to your name whenever you post or comment.

## Verified Company Badge Eligibility

To ensure that only legitimate and relevant companies receive a verified company badge, we've outlined the eligibility criteria below.

### Who is eligible for a Verified Company Badge?

✅ Employees with a valid work email from a recognized company domain.

✅ Full-time and part-time employees working directly for a company.

✅ Contractors working through a company email provided by the employer.

✅ Non-commercial organizations, such as non-profits, charities, or government entities.

### Who is not eligible for a Verified Company Badge (for now)?

❌ University or academic institution emails.

❌ Freelancers, even if using a unique domain, are not eligible.

❌ Personal portfolio sites, regardless of the domain used.

❌ Companies with websites that are not secured (e.g., lacking HTTPS).

❌ Companies with websites that fail to provide basic information like contact details, an “About Us” page, and details about their services or products.

❌ Temporary or disposable email addresses.

❌ Shared domain emails (e.g., info@domain.com, admin@domain.com).

❌ Companies with official websites that cannot be accessed for any reason, including broken links, 403 errors, non-secured domains, "under construction" pages, or any other issues that prevent verification of the company's existence.
