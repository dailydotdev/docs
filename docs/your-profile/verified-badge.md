## Prerequisites

To get a verified company badge, you need access to your work email. Make sure you can receive emails at this address, as you’ll need to verify it during the process.

## Benefits of the Verified Company Badge

- Showcase your professional affiliation directly on your profile.
- Build credibility by displaying a verified badge that confirms your employment.
- Stand out in discussions with a badge that appears next to your name whenever you post or comment.

## Verified Company Badge Eligibility

To ensure that only legitimate and relevant companies receive a verified company badge, we've outlined the eligibility criteria below.

### Who is eligible for a Verified Company Badge?

✅ Employees with a valid work email from a recognized company domain.

✅ Full-time and part-time employees working directly for a company.

✅ Contractors working through a company email provided by the employer.

✅ Non-commercial organizations, such as non-profits, charities, or government entities.

### Who is not eligible for a Verified Company Badge (for now)?

❌ University or academic institution emails.

❌ Freelancers, even if using a unique domain, are not eligible.

❌ Personal portfolio sites, regardless of the domain used.

❌ Companies with websites that are not secured (e.g., lacking HTTPS).

❌ Companies with websites that fail to provide basic information like contact details, an “About Us” page, and details about their services or products.

❌ Temporary or disposable email addresses.

❌ Shared domain emails (e.g., info@domain.com, admin@domain.com).

❌ Companies with official websites that cannot be accessed for any reason, including broken links, 403 errors, non-secured domains, "under construction" pages, or any other issues that prevent verification of the company's existence.

## How to Get Your Verified Company Badge

Getting verified starts with adding your work experience to your profile:

1. **Add your work experience**: Go to your [Profile Experience Settings](https://app.daily.dev/settings/profile/experience/work) and add your current workplace. You can auto-fill your work experience by uploading your CV for a quick shortcut.
2. **Mark it as current**: Make sure your workplace is set as your current position (check "I currently work here").
3. **Verify your employment**: Once your current workplace is added, you'll see an option to verify it. Click to start the verification process.
4. **Enter your work email**: Provide your work email address associated with your company.
5. **Complete verification**: Check your email for a 6-digit verification code and enter it on daily.dev. If your company is in our database, your badge will be activated automatically. Otherwise, your request will be reviewed and manually approved by our team.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while verifying your email or getting your badge, consider the following:

- **No verification option visible?** Make sure you've added your current workplace to your work experience and marked it as your current position.
- **Didn't receive the verification code?** Ensure your work email is correct and check your spam/junk folder.
- **Invalid code?** Double-check the verification code for accuracy. If it's incorrect, request a new code.
- **Company not recognized?** If your company isn't in our database, your request will be reviewed by our team. This process may take several days.
- **Need to update your verified workplace?** You can manage your work experience and verification status from your [Profile Experience Settings](https://app.daily.dev/settings/profile/experience/work).
