## How Does Reading History Work?

At daily.dev, we understand the challenge of keeping up with engaging content in a constantly changing feed. The **Reading History** feature lets you track every post you've read, so you never lose sight of valuable content. When you read a post, it may disappear from your feed after a few minutes due to the feed algorithm. With Reading History, you can easily revisit any post, even if it's no longer in your feed.

Additional options available within reading history:
- Save the post in your bookmarks.
- Upvote or downvote the post.
- Share the post.
- Remove the post from your reading history.
