## How Does Reading History Work?

At daily.dev, we understand the challenge of keeping up with engaging content in a constantly
changing feed. The **Reading History** feature lets you track every post you've read, so you never
lose sight of valuable content. When you read a post, it may disappear from your feed after a few
minutes due to the feed algorithm. With Reading History, you can easily revisit any post, even if
it's no longer in your feed.

Additional options available within reading history:

- Save the post in your bookmarks.
- Upvote or downvote the post.
- Share the post.
- Remove the post from your reading history.

## How to Access Your Reading History
