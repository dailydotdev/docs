## Key Features

- **Complete reading log** - Track every post you've read with timestamps
- **Post management** - Bookmark, upvote, or share directly from history
- **Easy access** - Multiple ways to reach your reading history
- **Content recovery** - Find posts that have disappeared from your feed
- **History cleanup** - Remove posts you no longer want to track

## How Reading History Works

Daily.dev's dynamic feed algorithm constantly updates to show you the most relevant content. When you read a post, it may disappear from your main feed within minutes. **Reading History** solves this problem by maintaining a permanent record of everything you've consumed.

### What You Can Do

Once you've read a post, it automatically appears in your reading history where you can:

- **Bookmark** the post for future reference
- **Upvote or downvote** to influence the algorithm
- **Share** with your network or on social media
- **Remove** from your reading history if no longer relevant
- **Revisit** the full content anytime
