### Milestone Celebrations

- **Congratulatory notifications** appear at each milestone
- **Customizable alerts** - opt out of notifications anytime in settings

### Weekend Flexibility

- **Weekend freeze** - Saturday and Sunday are grayed out in tracking
- **No streak penalty** - Skipping weekends won't break your streak
- **Bonus counting** - Weekend reading still counts and adds to your total
- **Personal customization** - Configure your preferred weekend days

## What Counts as a Reading Day?

Understanding how reading days are calculated helps you maintain consistent streaks:

### Content Engagement Requirements

**Standard Posts**
- Must click "Read post" and visit the original source
- Simply clicking on a post in the feed doesn't count
- Content must be actively consumed, not just viewed

**Video Content**  
- Opening the post counts as engagement
- Embedded player viewing qualifies immediately
- No need to visit external video platforms

**Squad Posts**
- Clicking and viewing within daily.dev is sufficient
- Full engagement tracking within the platform
- Internal content consumption counts

:::caution
**Daily engagement required**: Logging in alone isn't enough. You must actively consume content each day (except weekends) to maintain your streak.
