## Introduction to Reading Streaks

Creating a reading habit can significantly impact your personal and professional growth. Continuous learning keeps you updated with the latest trends, tools, and best practices in your field. To help you maintain this habit, we've introduced **Reading Streaks**. This feature provides motivation by celebrating your dedication to staying updated. Here's how it works:

## How It Works

### Milestones and Notifications

Celebrate your reading streak milestones with congratulatory pop-ups. Milestones follow a Fibonacci series. You can opt out of these notifications anytime.

### Reading Streak Icon

On the top right, you'll see the reading streak icon. It shows a flame once you've read the first post of the day. Before that, it appears as an empty icon outlined by a dotted line.

### Streak Tracking

Click on the reading streak icon to view your reading activity for the past week, including days read and skipped. The widget also displays your longest streak and total reading days since joining daily.dev.

### Weekend Freeze

Weekends are grayed out, and skipping them won't break your streak. If you read on weekends, those days are counted in your streak and marked with a flame.

## What Counts as a Reading Day?

For most content types on daily.dev, you need to go and read/watch the original content for it to qualify as a reading day. Simply clicking on a post in the feed isn't enough; you must click "Read post" and consume the content for it to count. For video content, it counts as a view just by opening the post since you can watch the video in the embedded player. There are some other exceptions, like Squad posts, where clicking on them inside daily.dev is sufficient. 

:::note
Additionally, it's not enough to simply log in to daily.dev once a day; you must consume something every day (except weekends) to maintain a streak.
