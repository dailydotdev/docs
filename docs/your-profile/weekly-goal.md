# Weekly Reading Goal

:::note
We recently applied a significant change to the Weekly Goal, resulting in a misalignment of goals between the Web App and the Browser Extension. To fix it, make sure you update your browser extension to v3.15.0 or later.

## What is the Weekly Goal?

Staying up to date requires us to **form a habit**. With daily.dev, creating such a habit is easier than ever before since you get all the content you need in one place! We built some extra stuff to help make this habit a bit more fun! That's what we call `Weekly Goals`!

## How does the Weekly Goal work?

The metric we use to count the Weekly Goals is fairly simple, and we call it `Reading Days`. You need to read at least one post per day to increase your reading days. The more reading days you nail, the higher the rank you will earn in a given week:

| Reading Days 	| Rank      	|
|--------------	|-----------	|
| 1            	| 🖤 Iron      	|
| 2            	| 🧡 Bronze    	|
| 3            	| 🤍 Silver    	|
| 4            	| 💛 Gold      	|
| 5            	| 💙 Platinum  	|
| 6            	| 💜 Diamond   	|
| 7            	| ❤️‍🔥 Legendary 	|

### How we count ranks

1. Ranks are being counted based on your **reading days**
2. Every week you can earn a **new rank**
3. Weeks are calculated from **Monday to Monday** (see the tip below)
4. When a rank is achieved, it will be **displayed in your sidebar** throughout the week and subsequent week
5. During the next week, you will need to **re-earn it**

:::tip
To sync your Weekly Goal with your current time zone, go to Account details -> Add time zone.

## Reading status per tag

In your Weekly Reading Goal popup, we also made it easier to understand what type of content you are reading! Since daily.dev is all about staying up to date, we thought it would be nice to show how updated you are based on the tags you read! Check it out here:

## Where do you see the ranks you've earned?

All the ranks you earned will appear **on your profile** (assuming you're a registered member of our community)!

In your profile you'll be able to see:
1. All the **ranks you earned** over time
2. Your **top tags** counted by reading days
3. A GitHub-style matrix of the **posts you read**

:::tip
Try to use the dropdown menu to change the date range in the `Activity` section of your profile. Using this option, you will see how your performance changed over time.

## Opt out from the Weekly Goal

Following some recent feedback, we realized that some people feel stressed due to the weekly Goal. Since we aim to help people create a reading habit, we added an option to opt-out of the Weekly Goal. You will no longer see the Weekly Goal widget in your sidebar by opting out.

To opt-out, follow these steps: 
1. Go to the `Customize` menu on the sidebar
2. Switch off the `Show Weekly Goal widget` toggle

:::note
The Weekly Goal also serves to establish social proof in the daily.dev community. Therefore, the opt-out option is designed to mitigate the "stressful" aspects it may create. After opting out, you will no longer see the Weekly Goal widget in the sidebar, but you will still be enrolled in the weekly Goal as a program, which means that your ranks and achievements will still appear on your profile page.
