# Creating an Organization

Creating an organization on daily.dev allows you to manage Plus subscriptions for your entire team. You can create an organization during the Plus checkout process or from your profile settings.

## Creating During Plus Checkout

When purchasing Plus, you have the option to buy for your team instead of just yourself:

1. **Navigate to Plus**: Go to the Plus page and click "Get Plus"
2. **Choose Team Option**: Select "Team" instead of "Personal" subscription
3. **Select Seats**: Choose the number of Plus seats you need for your team
4. **Organization Details**: Enter your organization name during checkout
5. **Complete Purchase**: Finish the payment process

Your organization will be automatically created upon successful payment, and you'll become the owner with the first seat assigned to you.

## Creating from Profile

If you already have Plus or want to create an organization separately:

1. **Access Profile Menu**: Click on your profile picture in the top navigation
2. **Select Organizations**: Choose "Organizations" from the dropdown menu
3. **Create New**: Click "Create Organization" if you're not a member of any organizations
4. **Organization Details**: 
   - Enter your organization name
   - Optionally upload an organization image
5. **Save**: Click "Create" to establish your organization

## Organization Setup

After creating your organization, you'll need to:

### Purchase Seats (if not done during checkout)
- Navigate to your organization's billing page
- Select the number of seats needed
- Complete the payment process

### Customize Your Organization
- **Name**: Choose a clear, recognizable name for your team
- **Image**: Upload a logo or image to represent your organization
- **Settings**: Configure any additional preferences

### Invite Team Members
- Get your organization's invite link from the members page
- Share the link with team members you want to add
- Team members can join by clicking the link (if seats are available)

## Important Notes

- **Owner Role**: The person who creates the organization automatically becomes the owner
- **Billing Responsibility**: The organization creator is responsible for the initial billing setup
- **Seat Management**: You can adjust the number of seats later through the billing page
- **Member Limits**: You can only assign Plus benefits up to the number of seats purchased
