# Organizations Overview

Organizations on daily.dev allow companies and teams to purchase and manage multiple Plus subscriptions for their members. This feature enables centralized management of Plus benefits, making it easier for teams to access premium features together.

## What are Organizations?

Organizations are team accounts that allow companies to:

- Purchase Plus subscriptions in bulk for their team members
- Centrally manage member access and permissions
- Assign and reassign Plus seats as needed
- Control billing and subscription management from one place

## Key Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Admins can manage all team members' Plus subscriptions from one dashboard
- **Flexible Seat Management**: Add or remove seats as your team grows or changes
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels for owners, admins, and members
- **Simplified Billing**: One subscription covers multiple team members
- **Easy Onboarding**: Invite team members with a simple invite link

## Getting Started

To get started with Organizations:

1. **Create an Organization**: Set up your team account during Plus checkout or from your profile
2. **Purchase Seats**: Buy the number of Plus seats you need for your team
3. **Invite Members**: Share your organization's invite link with team members
4. **Manage Access**: Assign Plus benefits and manage member roles as needed

## Organization Roles

Organizations have three distinct roles with different permissions:

### Owner
- **Full Control**: Complete access to all organization settings
- **Billing Management**: Can modify subscriptions and manage seats
- **Member Management**: Can add, remove, and promote members
- **Settings**: Can update organization name, image, and delete the organization
- **Unique Role**: Only one owner per organization

### Admin
- **Member Management**: Can invite, remove, and promote members
- **Plus Assignment**: Can assign or remove Plus benefits from members
- **Settings**: Can update organization name and image
- **No Billing Access**: Cannot modify subscriptions or billing

### Member
- **View Access**: Can see other organization members
- **Follow Members**: Can follow other team members
- **Limited Permissions**: Cannot manage other members or organization settings

## How It Works

1. **Purchase**: Choose team checkout when buying Plus and select the number of seats needed
2. **Setup**: Create your organization with a name and optional image
3. **Invite**: Share the invite link with team members you want to add
4. **Assign**: Team members automatically receive Plus benefits when they join (if seats are available)
5. **Manage**: Owners and admins can adjust seats, manage members, and update settings as needed

Organizations make it simple for teams to share the benefits of daily.dev Plus while maintaining control over access and billing.
