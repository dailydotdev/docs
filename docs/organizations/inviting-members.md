# Inviting Members to Your Organization

Organization admins and owners can invite team members to join their organization and receive Plus benefits. This guide covers the invitation process and best practices.

## How Invitations Work

### Invite Link System
Organizations use a unique invite link system:

- **Unique Links**: Each organization has its own permanent invite link
- **Simple Sharing**: Share the link via email, Slack, or any communication method
- **Automatic Join**: Team members click the link to join instantly
- **Seat Assignment**: Plus benefits are assigned automatically if seats are available

## Getting Your Invite Link

### Accessing the Invite Link

1. **Navigate to Members**: Go to your organization's members page
2. **Click "Invite Members"**: Open the invite modal
3. **Copy Link**: Copy the unique invite link for your organization
4. **Share**: Send the link to team members you want to invite

### Invite Modal Features
- **Link Display**: Shows your organization's unique invite link
- **Copy Button**: One-click copying to clipboard
- **Seat Status**: Displays available seats for new members
- **QR Code**: Some interfaces may include QR codes for easy mobile sharing

## Seat Availability

### Before Inviting
Check your seat availability:

- **Available Seats**: Ensure you have seats available for new members
- **Seat Limit**: You can only invite as many members as you have seats
- **Purchase More**: If needed, purchase additional seats before inviting

### No Available Seats
If you're out of seats:

- **Disabled Join**: The join button is disabled on the invite page
- **Clear Message**: Invited users see a message about seat availability
- **Manage Seats**: Use the "Manage Seats" button to purchase more seats

## Invitation Best Practices

### Effective Communication

## Managing Invitations

- **No Expiration**: Links don't expire but can be regenerated if compromised
- **Organization Specific**: Links only work for the specific organization
- **Seat Protection**: Users can only join if seats are available

### Managing Access
