# Cores

## What are Cores

Cores are the official in-app currency on daily.dev. They power a community-driven economy where developers support each other, reward high-quality content, and help surface ideas that matter.

Cores aren’t just symbolic, they’re a way to show appreciation that holds real weight. Every time you give or receive them, you’re helping build a more generous and value-based developer network.

:::info 
Cores are not cash, crypto, or legal tender. They can’t be used outside daily.dev, and their value is entirely tied to the experiences and features we enable within the platform.

## Why Cores matter

Likes are cheap. Cores aren’t.

They let you reward contributions that actually help you—whether it’s a great answer, a sharp insight, or a post that made you rethink something. The more Cores circulate, the stronger our community becomes.

For creators, this opens a new path: instead of chasing clicks, they can focus on creating value—and get rewarded for it.

:::tip
While today Cores are used mainly for rewarding content and creators, we’re actively building new features around them—including post boosts, premium interactions, exclusive content, and more. Holding Cores today means you’re ready for everything we launch next.

## ⚠️ Play fair, stay rewarded
