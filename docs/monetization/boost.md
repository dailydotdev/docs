## Where boosted posts appear

Boosted posts are featured across daily.dev in:

- The home feed  
- Squad feeds

Tracking your boosted posts can be done using the ads dashboard. To access it please click on your profile image and choose "Ads dashboard" from the dropdown menu.

Go to the **ads dashboard** to track:

- **Spend** – total cores used  
- **Impressions** – how many times your post appeared  
- **Clicks** – how many users tapped through  
- **Engagement** – upvotes, comments, bookmarks

Try running shorter, high-budget boosts to spike discovery during key moments, like a product launch or new article drop.
