# Boost

![boost your posts](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1752671864/docs/boost_post.png)

Grow your reach on daily.dev with our Boost tools. Promote your posts to get more views and engagement, or boost your Squad to attract new members. Whether you're sharing content or building a community, Boost helps you connect with the right developers using cores.

## Key features

**Automated targeting**: Our recommendation engine promotes your content to the right developers based on tags, reading habits, and engagement signals. No setup needed.

**Flexible budget control**: Set your daily budget in cores and choose how long your boost runs. You're always in control.

**Native placements**: Boosted content shows up in the feed, Squad directory, and discovery areas clearly labeled but fully integrated.

**Real-time insights**: Track spend, impressions, clicks, engagement, and growth metrics in the ads dashboard.

**Two boost types**: Promote individual posts for engagement or boost entire Squads to attract new members.

## Boost types

**How to boost a Squad:**

2. Click **Boost**.
3. Set your **daily budget** (in [Cores](monetization/cores.md)).
4. Choose the **number of days** to run the promotion.
5. Confirm the boost and let it run.

**Requirements for Squad Boost:**
- Squad must be public
- Squad must have a description, profile image, and cover image
- Only admins and moderators can boost
- Only one boost can run at a time per Squad

## Budget and duration

- **Daily budget**:  
  - Minimum: 1,000 cores  
  - Maximum: 100,000 cores  
- **Duration**: 1–30 days  
- **Total spend**: `daily budget × number of days`

You can stop a boost anytime. Unused cores are automatically credited back to your wallet.

## Where boosted content appears

### Post Boost placements
Boosted posts are featured across daily.dev in:
- The home feed  
- Squad feeds  
- Relevant tag feeds  
- Other discovery surfaces personalized per user

### Squad Boost placements
Boosted Squads appear as dedicated cards with Squad details in:
- **Main feed**: Prime ad slots with "Join Squad" call-to-action
- **Squad directory**: Featured section with priority placement
- Squad cards show: name, description, member count, cover image, and join button

All placements are labeled as *boosted* and respect the user experience.

## Performance tracking

Track your boost campaigns using the ads dashboard. Access it by clicking on your profile image and choosing "Ads dashboard" from the dropdown menu.

### Post Boost metrics
- **Spend** – total cores used  
- **Impressions** – how many times your post appeared  
- **Clicks** – how many users tapped through  
- **Engagement** – upvotes, comments, bookmarks

### Squad Boost metrics
- **Spend** – total cores used
- **Impressions** – how many times your Squad card appeared
- **Unique reach** – number of unique users who saw your Squad
- **New members** – users who joined your Squad during the campaign

Both boost types show real-time data and campaign progress in the ads dashboard.

Try running shorter, high-budget boosts to spike discovery during key moments, like a product launch or new article drop.

## Supporting Squad growth

You don't need to be an admin or moderator to help Squads grow. **Awards** are a great way to support your favorite communities:

- Give Awards on Squad posts or directly to the Squad itself
- Awards transfer cores directly to Squad admins and moderators  
- They can use those cores to boost the Squad and attract more members
- It's a community-driven way to help Squads you love reach more developers

## Managing active boosts

### Squad Boost management
- **Campaign status**: When a Squad is being boosted, the boost button shows "Boosting" in a disabled state
- **Stop anytime**: Only the person who started the boost can stop it via "Manage ad" in the three-dot menu
- **One at a time**: Only one admin/mod can boost a Squad at any given time
- **Refunds**: Unused cores are automatically refunded when you stop a campaign early

### Notifications
You'll receive notifications when:
- Your boost campaign completes (both email and in-app)
- Campaign progress updates during longer boosts
