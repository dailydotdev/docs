# Awards

## What are Awards  

Awards let you recognize top-tier contributions on daily.dev. They're powered by our in-app currency called [Cores](monetization/cores.md) and help spotlight content that's helpful, insightful, or just straight-up great. Whether it's an excellent post, an insightful comment, or consistent valuable contributions—you can now say "this is worth it" in a meaningful way.

## Why Awards matter  

Giving an Award sends a stronger signal that someone’s effort mattered. Awards help elevate the best content, encourage thoughtful participation, and build a culture where effort gets recognized and rewarded. They also unlock visibility for creators—great for reputation, motivation, and discovery.

## Why give Awards?  

- **Support what matters** – Show appreciation for content that taught you something, saved you time, or sparked new ideas.
- **Encourage great contributions** – Awards provide recognition for quality contributions. That recognition leads to more thoughtful posts and comments.
- **Shape the ecosystem** – The more great content gets awarded, the better daily.dev becomes for everyone.

## How Awards work


You can give Awards in a few simple steps:  
1. Click the award icon on a post, comment, or profile.  
2. Choose a sticker. Some are **free** and usable right away. Others are **premium** and require [Cores](monetization/cores.md).  
3. Add an optional note (recommended!).  
4. Confirm the Award. If it's a premium one, your Cores will be deducted.  
5. The recipient is notified, and your name appears as the supporter.

We're actively expanding access—so if it’s not live for you yet, stay tuned.

## What you can do with Awards  

- **Appreciate helpful content** – Drop a sticker on anything valuable: posts, comments, discussions.  
- **Add a personal message** – Say why it stood out. Optional, but adds meaning.  
- **Reward from profiles** – Support a creator directly from their profile, even if you’re not on a specific post.  
- **Build credibility** – Awards are public and show up across the platform—on content, profiles, and wallets.

## Free vs. paid Awards  

- **Free stickers** – Available to everyone. Use them anytime to show support.

- **On posts** – Next to likes and other actions.  
- **In comments** – Alongside replies and reactions.

## Who can see Awards  

Awards are public. Everyone can see:  
- Who gave the Award  
- Which sticker was used  
- Any attached message  
- Where it was given  

This transparency helps build trust and reputation across the community.

## Can I give anonymously? 

Not at the moment. When you give an Award, your profile will be shown as the supporter. We believe recognition is stronger when it’s personal—but we’re open to anonymous options in the future based on feedback.

## Report misuse
