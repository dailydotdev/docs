# Layout Options 

The layout option lets you select how posts are displayed on your **daily.dev feed**. Switch between **Grid mode** and **List mode** to suit your viewing preferences.

To switch between Grid and List mode, click on the **customize** option from the top-right profile menu, as shown below:

## Grid Mode for Content Display

The **Grid mode** displays posts as cards arranged in a grid format, as seen in the image below:

In Grid mode, posts are positioned both vertically and horizontally, making it easy to scan and interact with the content. Grid mode adapts seamlessly to various viewports and orientations, providing consistency across different platforms and screen sizes.

## List Mode for Simplified Layout

In **List mode**, posts are stacked vertically in a list, as shown below:

List mode displays posts in a simple, stacked format, showing only source images without cover images. This option is ideal if you prefer a shorter feed with fewer visuals.
