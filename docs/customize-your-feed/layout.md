# Layout

The layout option lets you select how posts are displayed on your feed. You can switch between **Grid mode** and **List mode**.

To switch between Grid and List mode, click on the customize option from the sidebar, as seen below:

## Grid mode

The Grid mode displays posts as cards arrayed in a Grid, as seen in the image below:

In Grid mode, posts are positioned vertically and horizontally from each other so that you can easily scan and interact with the posts on the feed. 

The Grid mode easily adapts to various viewports and orientations, thereby ensuring consistency across platforms and screen sizes. 


## List mode

In the list mode, posts are stacked in a list, as seen below:

In the list mode, posts are arranged in a stacked list.  List mode displays only source images and it does not contain cover images of posts. Using List mode is ideal if you like your feed shorter and with fewer visuals.
