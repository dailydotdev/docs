In Grid mode, posts are positioned vertically and horizontally from each other so that you can easily scan and interact with the posts on the feed. 

The Grid mode easily adapts to various viewports and orientations, thereby ensuring consistency across platforms and screen sizes. 


## List mode

In the list mode, posts are stacked in a list as seen below:

In the list mode, posts are arranged in a stacked list.  List mode displays only source images and it does not contain cover images of posts. Using List mode is ideal if you like your feed shorter and with fewer visuals.
