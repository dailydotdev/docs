## Grid Mode

The **Grid mode** displays posts as cards arranged in a grid format, as seen in the image below:

In Grid mode, posts are positioned both vertically and horizontally, making it easy to scan and interact with the content. Grid mode adapts seamlessly to various viewports and orientations, providing consistency across different platforms and screen sizes.

## List Mode

In **List mode**, posts are stacked vertically in a list, as shown below:

List mode displays posts in a simple, stacked format, showing only source images without cover images. This option is ideal if you prefer a shorter feed with fewer visuals.
