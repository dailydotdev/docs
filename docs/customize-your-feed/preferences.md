The preferences options allow you to fine-tune your **daily.dev** experience by toggling various features on or off. Currently, available options include:

- Show reading streaks
- Open links in a new tab
- Show custom shortcuts
- Show feed sorting menu
- Enable companion

### Accessibility
- Automatically dismiss notifications

## Show Reading Streaks

By default, daily.dev displays your reading streaks in the top right corner of your feed. If youâ€™d prefer to hide your reading streaks, set the `Show reading streaks` toggle switch to `off`.

## Open Links in a New Tab

When you click a post link on your feed using the `Read post` button, daily.dev will open that post in a new tab by default. To have posts open in the current tab instead, set the `Open links in new tab` toggle switch to `off`.

## Show Custom Shortcuts

Enable this option to access custom shortcuts at the top center of your feed.

## Show Feed Sorting Menu

Turning this toggle switch on adds a dropdown menu to the My Feed and Popular Feed sections, enabling sorting by `Date` or by `Recommended`, as shown below:

## Enable Companion Widget

Switching this toggle to `on` activates the [companion widget for daily.dev](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/the-companion), while setting it to `off` deactivates the widget.

The companion widget enhances your experience by allowing you to bookmark, comment, and upvote directly on the original post. To activate this widget, click on the **companion button** in the top-right corner of the daily.dev menu bar, as seen below:

Then click on the `Activate companion` button in the description box:

You will then be asked to grant additional permissions to display the companion widget directly on the original post.
