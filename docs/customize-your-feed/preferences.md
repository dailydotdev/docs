## Hide read posts

Turning this toggle switch `on` will make sure that every post you read will disappear from your feed after you've read it.

## Open link in new tab

The default setting in daily.dev is that links to posts are opened in a new tab. However, if you turn this toggle switch `off`, daily.dev will open post in your current tab.

## Show custom shortcuts

Turning this toggle switch `off` will hide the quick links to your custom shortcuts/most visited sites from the feed.

## Show feed sorting menu

Turning this toggle switch on will add a dropdown menu to My feed and Popular feed, enabling you to sort those feeds `By date` or by `Recommendation`. 

## Show weekly goal widget

Turning this toggle switch `off`, you will no longer see the [weekly goal widget](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/your-profile/weekly-goal) in your sidebar.

## Enable companion

Turning this toggle switch `on` will activate the [companion widget](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/the-companion).
