# Bookmark Folders

## What Are Bookmark Folders?  

**Bookmark Folders** help you organize your saved posts into structured, easy-to-access categories. Whether you're a casual reader or a power user managing hundreds (or thousands) of bookmarks, this feature allows you to group and manage saved content efficiently.  

## Why Use Bookmark Folders?  

- **Stay organized** – Group saved posts into folders for easy access and better management.  
- **Find content faster** – Quickly locate specific bookmarks without scrolling through endless lists.  
- **Unlock full control with Plus** – Create up to **100 folders** with personalized options like descriptions and emojis.  
- **Seamless management** – Move posts between folders, rename folders, and delete them as needed.  
- **Collaborate and share** – Share folders with others to collaborate or share valuable resources.  

## Key Features  

### Folder Creation  
Organize your saved posts into dedicated folders for streamlined access:  
- **Free users** – Save bookmarks in the default **Quick Saves** folder. You can create **one custom folder** to try the feature.  
- **Plus subscribers** – Unlock **folder creation** (up to 100 folders) and enjoy full control over your saved content.  

### Add Descriptions and Emojis  
Customize folders with **descriptions** and **emojis** to make them easier to recognize at a glance.  

### Moving Bookmarks  
Quickly reorganize saved content by moving posts between folders using the **ellipsis menu** on each bookmark. A confirmation toast will appear once the move is complete.  

### Default Folder Assignment  
- **Plus users** – Bookmarked posts automatically save to your **last-used folder** by default.  
- **Free users** – Posts are saved to the **Quick Saves** section.  

### Folder Management  
Manage your folders directly from the bookmark section:  
- **Rename folders** – Update folder names from the **ellipsis menu**.  
- **Delete folders** – Remove empty folders instantly; for folders with content, confirmation is required before deletion.  
- **Edit bookmarks** – Rename or move saved posts within folders for better organization.
