# Presidential Briefing

Meet the Presidential Briefing. Your personal AI agent that does the impossible so you don't have to.

The system scans hundreds of posts, videos, Squad threads, changelogs, and releases daily across the developer ecosystem. It processes all of this content and delivers a personalized, high-impact briefing written just for you.

A briefing so sharp, it could save you hundreds of hours over time and keep you ahead of everyone else.

Each briefing provides essential updates in 3â€“5 minutes.

## What's inside the Briefing?

The Presidential Briefing is divided into three sections, each with a specific purpose:

### Must Know

The critical stuff. A couple of high-signal highlights the agent believes you must read to stay in the know, based on your profile, interests, and behavior.

### Good to Know

Stories and updates that broaden your perspective. Not everything here is tailored to your usual taste, but it's all relevant and worth your time. Think of it as curated horizon-expansion.

### Critical Analysis

Welcome to your built-in content verification system. We identify the biggest pieces of hype, misinformation, or misleading information circulating in the developer world. It's your shield against unreliable information and your tool for critical thinking.
