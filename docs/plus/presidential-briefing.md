# Presidential Briefing

Meet the Presidential Briefing ü§ù Your personal AI agent that does the impossible so you don't have to.

Every day, it scans hundreds of posts, videos, Squad threads, changelogs, and releases across the dev world. It reads and watches everything (yes‚Ä¶ it's sick. We know). Then it compresses the signal into a personalized, high-impact post, written just for you.

This isn't a fancy summary. It's a fully autonomous system that works behind the scenes to keep you effortlessly in the know. It adapts to your habits, your reading style, and your pace. The result? A briefing so sharp, it could save you hundreds of hours over time and keep you ahead of everyone else.

No templates. No fluff. Just 3‚Äì5 minutes that make you feel caught up, not buried.

## Why you'll love it

## What's inside the Briefing?

The Presidential Briefing is divided into three sections, each with a specific purpose:

### Must Know

The critical stuff. A couple of high-signal highlights the agent believes you must read to stay in the know, based on your profile, interests, and behavior.

### Good to Know

Stories and updates that broaden your perspective. Not everything here is tailored to your usual taste, but it's all relevant and worth your time. Think of it as curated horizon-expansion.

### Bullshit Police üíÄ

Welcome to your built-in bullshit detector. We call out the biggest pieces of hype, misinformation, or plain nonsense circulating in the dev world. It's your shield against fake news and your secret weapon in any watercooler debate.
