## Why Public Squads Transform Communities

Building developer communities from scratch is challenging—finding engaged members, maintaining discussions, and establishing credibility takes time. **Public Squads** solve these problems by connecting you with daily.dev's active developer ecosystem where meaningful conversations already happen.

### The Public Squad Advantage

**Immediate Access to Engaged Developers**
Skip the cold-start problem by connecting with developers already active on daily.dev. These aren't passive users—they're engaged professionals who read, discuss, and share developer content daily.

**Built-in Discovery Mechanism**
The [Squads Directory](https://app.daily.dev/squads) serves as your primary growth engine, organizing communities by technology focus and making it easy for developers to find exactly what they're looking for.

**Quality Member Attraction**
Public status attracts developers genuinely interested in your focus area, leading to higher-quality discussions and more valuable community interactions than generic networking platforms.

:::tip
