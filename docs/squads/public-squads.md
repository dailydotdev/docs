# Becoming a Public Squad

## Introduction to Public Squads

Building a developer community is tough. Thatâ€™s why we built daily.dev Squadsâ€”to make it easier to create a thriving developer community from day one. With Public Squads, you can start building your community while tapping into the global daily.dev ecosystem, where developers are already active and engaged.

Public Squads are the best way to feature your content and gain organic exposure on daily.dev. These Squads are open to everyone and discoverable in the [Squads Directory](https://app.daily.dev/squads). They help you connect with developers who share your interests, making it easier to create a vibrant, active community.
