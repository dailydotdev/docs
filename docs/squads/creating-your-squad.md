# Creating Your Squad

![A cover image for squads](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1690467943/docs/Update%20July%202023/-_Private_squads_v3_2.png)

## What is a Squad?

A Squad is a developer-focused group where members can come together to learn, interact, and engage on topics that matter to them. Think of Squads as tailored online communities specifically for developers. Squads facilitate knowledge sharing, discussions, and peer interactions, making them ideal for teams, projects, communities, or niche interests.

A Squad can be **Public** or **Private**:
- **Public Squads**: Open to all developers and discoverable in the Squad Directory. Public Squads enjoy additional benefits like wider exposure and being featured in categories.
- **Private Squads**: Invite-only, ensuring more controlled membership.

## Key Features of Squads

Squads offer several interactive features to create an engaging experience:

✨ **Create a Squad**: Customize your Squad with a unique name, handle, image, description, and select a category for Public Squads.

✨ **Invite Members**: Bring in developers to discuss, share resources, and collaborate.

✨ **Post & Share Content**: Depending on settings, posting can be open to everyone or restricted to moderators. Enjoy full Markdown compatibility for rich discussions.

✨ **Moderation Tools**: As an admin, you have tools to manage posts, comments, and member interactions. 

✨ **Integrate with Work Tools**: Kickstart collaboration by integrating your Squad with work-related tools, such as Slack. This makes setup seamless and enables stronger team alignment.

## How to Create a Squad

Starting a Squad is easy. Follow these steps:

1. **Start a New Squad**: In the left sidebar, click the "New Squad" button or find it in the Directory.
2. **Name Your Squad**: Choose a name and handle that captures the focus of your Squad.
3. **Add an Image**: Upload a profile image for your Squad, such as a logo or icon.
4. **Write a Description**: Explain the theme, objectives, and member expectations for your Squad.
5. **Select a Category** *(Public Squads Only)*: Choose a category that best fits your Squad from options like Languages, Web, AI, Career, and more.

## Squad Visibility: Private vs. Public

When creating a Squad, select the desired visibility:

1. **Private Squads**: Accessible only by invite, with content visible only to members.
2. **Public Squads**: Open and discoverable in the Squads Directory, allowing developers to join freely. 

Public Squads must select a category during setup. Categories like Web, Mobile, AI, and Fun help users discover Squads that align with their interests.

Good luck! We can’t wait to see your community thrive ✨
