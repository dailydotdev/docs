# Growing Your Squad

## Managing posts

In a Squad, posts form the backbone of discussion and engagement. They are where you and your members can share valuable content and start meaningful discussions.

## Creating a post

1. **Create a New Post**: Inside your Squad, click on the "New post" button.
2. **Add Content**: You can write a post from scratch or share links from the daily.dev feed or external sources. Add a title and description for the content to provide context to your members.
3. **Post**: Click "Post" to share your content with the Squad.

## Commenting on a Post

Engage with posts by adding comments:

1. **Select a Post**: Click on a post that you want to comment on.
2. **Write a Comment**: At the bottom of the post, you'll find a comment box. Write your thoughts, questions, or any input you want to share.

By regularly creating posts and engaging in discussions, you can foster an active and dynamic community in your Squad.

## Inviting people to your Squad

2. **Invite Developers**: Click on the "Copy invitation link" button to copy your personal invitation link to your clipboard.
3. **Send Invitations**: use your personal invitation link and send it via email, your favorite messaging app or post it on social media.
