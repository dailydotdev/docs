## Commenting on a Post

Keep the conversation going by adding comments to posts:

By actively creating posts and engaging in discussions, you can cultivate an active and vibrant community in your Squad.

## The New Squads Directory

Public Squads are now automatically added to the [Squads Directory](https://app.daily.dev/squads), a curated space where developers can discover communities that align with their interests.  

### Categories in the Directory

When creating a Public Squad, you must select a category that fits your Squad's theme. Categories include:  
- **Featured**: Editor’s choice for top Squads on the platform.  
- **Languages**: Programming language-specific communities.  
- **Web, Mobile, DevOps & Cloud, AI, Games**: Development-focused categories.  
- **DevTools**: Squads by or for developer tools companies.  
- **Career**: Topics around career growth, leadership, and skills development.  
- **Open Source, DevRel, Fun**: Specialized communities for unique developer interests.

### Tips for Gaining Visibility in the Directory

To improve your chances of being featured in the directory:  
1. **Optimize Your Metadata**: Add an engaging image, clear description, and select the most relevant category.  
2. **Grow Membership**: Invite members to join and participate actively.  
3. **Post Consistently**: Regular high-quality posts boost engagement and visibility.  

## Accelerate Growth with Boost

Ready to fast-track your Squad's growth? **Boost** gives admins and moderators powerful tools to reach more developers and grow faster.

### Squad Boost
Promote your entire Squad to attract new members:
- **Targeted exposure**: Your Squad appears as dedicated cards in the main feed and Squad directory
- **Smart targeting**: Automatically shown to developers interested in your Squad's topics
- **Full control**: Set your budget in [cores](/docs/monetization/cores) and track new members in real-time
- **Requirements**: Squad must be public with description, profile image, and cover image

### Post Boost  
Amplify your Squad's best content:
- **Boost Squad posts**: Promote high-quality posts from your Squad to reach more developers
- **Increase engagement**: Get more views, upvotes, and comments on important content
- **Cross-promotion**: Boosted Squad posts can attract users to join your community

:::tip
Combine both strategies: Use Squad Boost for member acquisition and Post Boost to showcase your best content. Members can also support your Squad by giving [Awards](/docs/monetization/cores#awards), which transfer cores directly to admins and moderators for future boosts.
