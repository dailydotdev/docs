## The New Squads Directory

Public Squads are now automatically added to the [Squads Directory](https://app.daily.dev/squads), a curated space where developers can discover communities that align with their interests.  

### Categories in the Directory

When creating a Public Squad, you must select a category that fits your Squad's theme. Categories include:  
- **Featured**: Editorâ€™s choice for top Squads on the platform.  
- **Languages**: Programming language-specific communities.  
- **Web, Mobile, DevOps & Cloud, AI, Games**: Development-focused categories.  
- **DevTools**: Squads by or for developer tools companies.  
- **Career**: Topics around career growth, leadership, and skills development.  
- **Open Source, DevRel, Fun**: Specialized communities for unique developer interests.

### Tips for Gaining Visibility in the Directory

To improve your chances of being featured in the directory:  
1. **Optimize Your Metadata**: Add an engaging image, clear description, and select the most relevant category.  
2. **Grow Membership**: Invite members to join and participate actively.  
3. **Post Consistently**: Regular high-quality posts boost engagement and visibility.  

## Building an Engaged Community

An active Squad is key to growth. By regularly posting, approving member contributions, and sparking discussions, your Squad can become a vibrant hub for developers.

Good luck with growing your Squad! ðŸš€
