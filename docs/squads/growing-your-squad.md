# Growing Your Squad

## Managing posts

In a Squad, posts form the backbone of discussion and engagement. They are where you and your members can share valuable content and start meaningful discussions.

## Creating a post

1. **Create a New Post**: Inside your Squad, click on the "New post" button.
2. **Add Content**: You can write a post from scratch or share links from the daily.dev feed or external sources. Add a title and description for the content to provide context to your members.
3. **Post**: Click "Post" to share your content with the Squad.

## Commenting on a Post

Engage with posts by adding comments:

1. **Select a Post**: Click on a post that you want to comment on.

By regularly creating posts and engaging in discussions, you can foster an active and dynamic community in your Squad.

## Apply to become a Public Squad

As your Squad grows and becomes more active, you might consider transitioning it to a public status. Making your Squad public can significantly increase its visibility and engagement within the daily.dev community:

1. **Increased Exposure**: Public Squads are featured in the daily.dev feed, reaching a wider audience.
2. **Community Building**: Public status enables you to connect with more developers and foster a larger community.
