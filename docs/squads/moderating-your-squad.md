## Essential Moderation Tools

### Content Approval System

**Post Approval Workflow** 
Public Squads operate with member posting enabled by default, but all content requires admin or moderator approval before going live:

- **Quality control** - Ensure all content aligns with community standards
- **Relevance filtering** - Keep discussions focused on Squad topics
- **Spam prevention** - Block low-quality or promotional content
- **Editorial oversight** - Maintain consistent content quality

**Approval Process**
1. **Member submits post** - Content enters the approval queue
2. **Admin/moderator review** - Evaluate content against community guidelines
3. **Approve or decline** - Accept quality content, reject problematic posts
4. **Provide feedback** - Help authors improve declined content
5. **Re-approval requirement** - Edited posts need fresh approval

### Content Management Controls

**Post and Comment Moderation**
- **Delete inappropriate content** - Remove posts that violate guidelines
- **Edit for clarity** - Make minor corrections to improve readability
- **Pin important posts** - Highlight key community information
- **Archive old content** - Organize historical discussions

**Content Quality Standards**
- Professional, developer-focused discussions
- Relevant to Squad's technology or topic area
- Constructive, helpful, and respectful tone
- No spam, self-promotion, or off-topic content

## Post Management Workflows

### Content Review Process

**Daily Review Routine**
Establish consistent content review practices for effective Squad management:

1. **Check approval queue** - Review pending posts daily or as they arrive
2. **Evaluate against standards** - Apply your community guidelines consistently  
3. **Provide constructive feedback** - Help authors understand approval decisions
4. **Monitor post performance** - Track which approved content generates best engagement

**Approval Decision Framework**
- ‚úÖ **Approve**: High-quality, relevant, constructive content
- üîÑ **Request revisions**: Good content that needs minor improvements
- ‚ùå **Decline**: Off-topic, low-quality, or inappropriate content

:::tip
**Constructive feedback helps growth**: When declining posts, explain why and suggest improvements to help members create better content.
:::

### Content Removal and Cleanup

**Removing Problematic Content**

1. **Identify content** requiring removal (posts or comments)
2. **Access moderation menu** via the three-dot options menu
3. **Select "Delete"** and confirm the action in the dialog
4. **Document decisions** for consistency and appeals if needed

**When to Remove Content**
- Violations of platform or Squad guidelines
- Spam or excessive self-promotion
- Harassment or toxic behavior
- Off-topic discussions that derail conversations
- Outdated information that could mislead members

### User Management and Enforcement

**Progressive Enforcement Strategy**

**Warning System**
- **First violation**: Private message with guideline explanation
- **Second violation**: Public reminder of community standards
- **Repeated violations**: Temporary restrictions or removal

**Blocking Members**
For persistent rule violations:

1. **Locate the user** in your member management panel
2. **Select "Block user"** from their profile options
3. **Choose duration** (temporary or permanent)
4. **Document the reason** for future reference
5. **Unblock when appropriate** through the same member panel

:::caution
**Use blocking judiciously**: Blocking should be reserved for clear, repeated violations after warnings. Focus on education and community building over punishment.
