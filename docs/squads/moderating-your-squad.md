# Moderating Your Squad

## Admin, Moderation, and Privacy Settings

As a Squad admin, you have various tools and settings to help manage your Squad effectively. These tools enable you to foster a respectful and engaging environment for your members.

Note: The tools described here are foundational for Squad management. We’re actively developing advanced moderation options to support even more effective community management.

## Key Moderation Features

**Post Approval**: Public Squads allow all members to post by default, but admins and moderators must approve posts before they go live. This ensures content aligns with your Squad's code of conduct and quality expectations.

**Content Moderation**: Admins can delete posts and comments that violate guidelines to maintain a healthy discussion environment.

**User Management**: Block users who repeatedly violate guidelines, and reverse the action if necessary.

**Role Assignments**: Assign roles such as moderators or admins to trusted members to distribute management responsibilities.

**Reporting and Feedback**: Members can now report inappropriate Squads or posts. Reported content is reviewed by the daily.dev moderation team to maintain a safe and inclusive platform.

## Managing Posts

### Approving and Declining Posts

Public Squads have default settings where all members can post, but posts require admin or moderator approval.  

1. **Approve or Decline Posts**: Review posts in the approval queue.
2. **Decline with Feedback**: Provide a reason for declining posts to help the author improve.  
3. **Re-approval for Edits**: Posts must be re-approved after edits to prevent bypassing the moderation process.

### Deleting Posts and Comments

1. **Navigate to the Content**: Find the post or comment you need to delete.
2. **Select "Delete"**: Use the options menu to remove the content permanently. Confirm the action in the pop-up window.

### Blocking Users

If a member repeatedly violates guidelines:  
1. **Find the User**: Locate the user in the member list.  
2. **Select "Block"**: This removes them from the Squad and prevents rejoining.  
3. **Unblock if Necessary**: You can reverse this action through the member list.

## Managing Permissions

Control member actions through the "Permissions" section in your Squad settings:  
- **Posting Permissions**: Decide who can post and whether post approval is required (default for Public Squads).  
- **Invitation Permissions**: By default, all members can invite others to join the Squad. Adjust this if needed.  
- **Group Guidelines**: Create a pinned welcome post outlining the rules and expectations for members.

## Member Roles

Squad members can have different roles with distinct permissions:

- **Member**: Can read and write posts and comments, as allowed by permissions.  
- **Moderator**: Can manage posts, comments, and members following the rules set.  
- **Admin**: Full control over posts, comments, members, and Squad settings, including privacy and permissions.

1. **Promoting to Moderator or Admin**: Find a member in the list and select "Promote to Moderator" or "Make an Admin."  
2. **Demoting Moderators**: Demote a moderator back to a member if they fail to meet responsibilities by selecting "Demote to Member."  

## Privacy Settings

Decide whether your Squad is Public or Private:  
- **Public Squads**: Open and discoverable in the Squads Directory.  
- **Private Squads**: Invite-only, with content visible only to members.

Public Squads must comply with daily.dev’s content guidelines to maintain their visibility.

## Tips for Effective Moderation

- Set clear rules and expectations in a pinned post.  
- Actively review and approve posts to maintain quality.  
- Assign trusted members as moderators to share the workload.  
- Regularly engage with members to foster a sense of community.

Effective moderation supports community growth and maintains quality standards.
