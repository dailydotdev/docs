# Moderating Your Squad

## Admin, Moderation, and Privacy Settings

As a Squad admin, you have various tools and settings to help manage your Squad effectively. These tools enable you to foster a respectful and engaging environment for your members.

Note: The tools described here are foundational for Squad management. Weâ€™re actively developing advanced moderation options to support even more effective community management.

## Key Moderation Features

âœ¨ **Post Approval**: Public Squads allow all members to post by default, but admins and moderators must approve posts before they go live. This ensures content aligns with your Squadâ€™s code of conduct and quality expectations.  

âœ¨ **Content Moderation**: Admins can delete posts and comments that violate guidelines to maintain a healthy discussion environment.  

âœ¨ **User Management**: Block users who repeatedly violate guidelines, and reverse the action if necessary.  

âœ¨ **Role Assignments**: Assign roles such as moderators or admins to trusted members to distribute management responsibilities.

âœ¨ **Reporting and Feedback**: Members can now report inappropriate Squads or posts. Reported content is reviewed by the daily.dev moderation team to maintain a safe and inclusive platform.

## Managing Posts

### Approving and Declining Posts

Public Squads have default settings where all members can post, but posts require admin or moderator approval.  

1. **Approve or Decline Posts**: Review posts in the approval queue.
2. **Decline with Feedback**: Provide a reason for declining posts to help the author improve.  
3. **Re-approval for Edits**: Posts must be re-approved after edits to prevent bypassing the moderation process.

### Deleting Posts and Comments

1. **Navigate to the Content**: Find the post or comment you need to delete.
2. **Select "Delete"**: Use the options menu to remove the content permanently. Confirm the action in the pop-up window.

### Blocking Users

If a member repeatedly violates guidelines:  
1. **Find the User**: Locate the user in the member list.  
2. **Select "Block"**: This removes them from the Squad and prevents rejoining.  
3. **Unblock if Necessary**: You can reverse this action through the member list.

## Managing Permissions

Control member actions through the "Permissions" section in your Squad settings:  
- **Posting Permissions**: Decide who can post and whether post approval is required (default for Public Squads).  
- **Invitation Permissions**: By default, all members can invite others to join the Squad. Adjust this if needed.  
- **Group Guidelines**: Create a pinned welcome post outlining the rules and expectations for members.

## Member Roles

Squad members can have different roles with distinct permissions:

- **Member**: Can read and write posts and comments, as allowed by permissions.  
- **Moderator**: Can manage posts, comments, and members following the rules set.  
- **Admin**: Full control over posts, comments, members, and Squad settings, including privacy and permissions.

1. **Promoting to Moderator or Admin**: Find a member in the list and select "Promote to Moderator" or "Make an Admin."  
2. **Demoting Moderators**: Demote a moderator back to a member if they fail to meet responsibilities by selecting "Demote to Member."  

## Privacy Settings

Decide whether your Squad is Public or Private:  
- **Public Squads**: Open and discoverable in the Squads Directory.  
- **Private Squads**: Invite-only, with content visible only to members.

Public Squads must comply with daily.devâ€™s content guidelines to maintain their visibility.

## Tips for Effective Moderation

- Set clear rules and expectations in a pinned post.  
- Actively review and approve posts to maintain quality.  
- Assign trusted members as moderators to share the workload.  
- Regularly engage with members to foster a sense of community.

Effective moderation is key to growing a vibrant, respectful, and valuable Squad. ðŸš€
