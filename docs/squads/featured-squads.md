# Getting Featured on the Squads Directory

![Squads Directory Feature](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb28a405-1c0d-45f8-a8a2-6cfa278ce84e)

The [Squads Directory](https://app.daily.dev/squads) on daily.dev is a curated space where community members can discover new and engaging Public Squads. Being featured in the directory significantly boosts your Squad's visibility and membership. If you have a Public Squad and aim to expand its reach, the directory is the perfect place to grow.

## How to Get Featured in the Directory

Public Squads are automatically added to the Squads Directory once they are created and as long as they are well-maintained, but being featured in the directory is reserved for top-performing, high-quality Squads that meet specific criteria.

### Tips for Increasing Your Chances of Being Featured

1. **Choose the Right Category**: Make sure your Squad is placed in the most relevant category during setup (e.g., Languages, Web, AI). Choosing the right category helps your Squad reach the right audience.

2. **Optimize Your Metadata**:
   - **Squad Image**: Use an eye-catching and relevant image for your Squad.
   - **Description**: Write a clear and compelling description that highlights your Squadâ€™s value and purpose.
   - **Engaging Title**: Use a concise and descriptive title that attracts interest.

3. **Post High-Quality Content**:
   - Share meaningful and engaging posts consistently.
   - Curate tutorials, articles, and videos relevant to your communityâ€™s interests.
   - Use Markdown to format content professionally.

4. **Foster Active Engagement**:
   - Encourage members to participate in discussions and post content.
   - Engage with members by responding to comments and sharing feedback.

5. **Grow Your Membership**:
   - Actively invite developers who would benefit from your Squad.
   - Promote your Squad through external channels like social media or your Slack workspace.

6. **Maintain Compliance**:
   - Follow daily.devâ€™s content guidelines.
   - Approve only high-quality, non-spammy posts.
   - Monitor and report inappropriate content or behavior to keep your community safe.

## Benefits of Being Featured

Featured Squads gain several advantages that help them grow faster:

- **Increased Visibility**: Featured Squads are prominently displayed in the directory, making them more discoverable.  
- **Credibility Boost**: The "Featured" badge signals quality and authority, encouraging more developers to join.  
- **Engagement Opportunities**: Featured Squads often attract more active members, driving richer discussions and interactions.

The directory organizes Squads into categories to help developers find communities aligned with their interests. Categories include:
