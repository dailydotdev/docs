Integrate your Slack workspace with daily.dev Squads to streamline communication and keep your team updated with the latest posts. This integration makes it easier to kickstart your Squad, autofill details during setup, and ensure you never miss important updates.

## Benefits of Slack Integration

- **Seamless Setup**: During Squad creation, you can integrate with Slack to automatically populate your Squad’s details like name, description, and profile image.  
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive instant notifications in Slack whenever new posts are published in your Squad.  
- **Team Collaboration**: Keep your team engaged and informed without switching platforms.  
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Focus on meaningful discussions while staying updated on Squad activity.

## How to Set Up Slack Integration

### During Squad Creation

1. **Choose Slack Integration**: When creating a new Squad, select the Slack integration option.  
2. **Authorize Access**: Grant daily.dev access to your Slack workspace to autofill Squad details.  
3. **Review and Finalize**: Confirm the Squad’s name, description, and image pre-populated from Slack. Make any additional edits as needed.  
4. **Start Engaging**: Your Squad is now ready with Slack integration in place.

### Connecting an Existing Squad to Slack

1. **Go to Your Squad**: Navigate to the Squad you want to integrate with Slack.
2. **Connect to Slack**: In your Squad’s settings, locate the **"Connect to Slack"** button and click it.
3. **Authorize and Choose a Channel**: Authorize daily.dev to access your Slack workspace and select the Slack channel where you’d like to receive notifications.

### Connecting a Squad to a Private Channel

1. **Manually Add the Bot to Your Private Channel**:

   - Manually add the daily.dev bot/app by typing `/invite @daily.dev` in the channel.
