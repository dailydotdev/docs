### Staying up to date takes a lot of time and effort

It's essential for every developer, yet it's not a simple thing at all! Why?
1. There are so many publications
2. Low-quality content is all around
3.  The tech world is rapidly changing

That's what made us build daily.dev.

## How to read the docs?

### Step 1: Install 🚀

daily.dev comes both as a [browser extension](/getting-started/browser-extension-installation.md) and as a [progressive web app](/getting-started/pwa.md). Pick your preferred platform (or just use them both), and you're good to go! 

### Step 2: Set up your personal feed 🎯

Once you're in, the ultimate way to stay updated is to [create your personal feed](/settingyourfeed/filtering-content-feed.md). 

### Step 3: Engage with other developers 👏

Learn more about our [key features](/key-features/default-feeds.md) and start engaging with other devs on our platform. 

### Step 4: Build your presence 🦸

Sign up is voluntary, but we highly recommend you to [create a profile](/your-profile/registration.md). That way, you will build your online presence and show the world what you have achieved. 

### Step 5: Customize the look and feel 🌈

Make daily.dev look precisely how you want it to be! [Customize](/customize-your-feed/layout.md) the theme, layout, density, and a bunch of other cool preferences. 

### Step 6: Explore behind the scenes 👀

If you want to learn [how does daily.dev work](/how-does-daily-dev-work/dailydev-101.md) we got you covered.
