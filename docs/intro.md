# Introduction

daily.dev provides the latest tech news and articles in one place. 

We take over 600 tech news sources, find the best articles on each of them and put those articles into a single feed. You can then tailor this feed to your interests and specialisms using tags!

Above all, we help you save time finding high-quality articles so you can stay up to date (and stay ahead of the curve) as a developer.

## Quick start guide
We want you to get the most out of daily.dev, so we put this quick start guide together so you can get the most out of our platform and our community.

### Step 1: Install 🚀

daily.dev comes both as a [browser extension](/getting-started/browser-extension-installation.md) and as a [progressive web app](/getting-started/pwa.md). 

We recommend the extension as it will set your new tab to show daily.dev and help you form a good reading habit. 

Don't worry though, you can always pause the new tab functionality if you need to focus!

### Step 2: Set up your personal feed 🎯

Once you've installed the extension (or you are on the web app), the next step is to [create your personal feed](/setting-up-your-feed/filtering-content-feed.md). 

This will allow you to tailor daily.dev to your preferences and interests, providing you with the most relevant tech and developer news.

### Step 3: Engage with other developers 👏

Check out some of our [key features](/key-features/feeds.md) and start engaging with other devs on our platform to help grow your professional network and make new connections. 

### Step 4: Build your presence 🦸

You do not have to register with daily.dev, but we highly recommend you do so you can [create a profile](/your-profile/registration.md). 

That way you can:
- comment on articles, 
- upvote, 
- bookmark useful articles,
- showcase your reading with our DevCard, and much more! 

### Step 5: Customize the look and feel 🌈
