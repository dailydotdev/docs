## What will be covered here?

One of the most common questions we get from our community is "how to get my post picked up by daily.dev?". In this post, I'll cover a few ways and best practices that you can use to get a chance to be listed on daily.dev.

## How to get your post picked up?

Practically there are three ways you can get listed on daily.dev:

1. Publish guest posts on well-known publications
2. Publish posts on developer blogging platforms
3. Submit a post through the [Community Picks](../key-features/community-picks.md) feature [beta]

### Option 1 - Publish guest posts on well-known publications

Probably the most reliable way to get a post you wrote to be picked by daily.dev is to publish it on a well-known programming publication. Many of those publications are already included in the source list of daily.dev. 

By now, all of the significant developer-related magazines are serving as a content source of daily.dev. To find out if a specific magazine is a content source on daily.dev, please use the search function in our feed. 

Once you find one magazine you like, we suggest checking if they allow guest posting on their publication. Then go through the guest posting process of the publication you chose. Once the post gets published, it will be picked up by daily.dev.

### Option 2 - Publish posts on developer blogging platforms

Nowadays, many developers choose to host their blogs on a blogging platform. The main advantage of this method is that you can get people to discover your content. Whereas building a new website will take you much time and effort to build your readership. Each platform has its own merits, and we are not affiliated with any of them.

However, to give you an easy head-start, you may want to check out developer blogging platforms such as [DEV](https://dev.to/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), or [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/). All of the platforms were qualified as content sources of daily.dev. 

:::note
We are not collecting **all** the posts published on blogging platforms. Our system will only pick a post from a blogging platform once it has gained enough traction/engagement on it. That's our way to ensure that we source qualified content.

### Option 3 - Submit a post through the Community Picks feature (beta)

## Getting notified when your post is listed

We've built a system that notifies the authors of posts once their posts are picked up by daily.dev. Learn more about the features we have to offer [for content creators](https://daily.dev/blog/claiming-ownership-on-an-post-you-wrote).

## Wrap up

Getting listed on daily.dev is straightforward if you follow the methods mentioned above. Whether you publish your post in a magazine or on a developer blogging platform shouldn't make a big difference. So go ahead and pick the optimal method that works for your best interest.
