# What is daily.dev?​​​​

## Introduction

daily.dev is a [browser extension](https://r.daily.dev/get?_ga=2.261969610.699932471.1636269766-1760427973.1590047745) and a [web app](https://app.daily.dev/) that helps developers stay updated on the latest programming news. Essentially it's a feed of articles we gather from the best tech blogs on any programming topic.

## How does daily.dev work?

When you use daily.dev for the first time, you will see the hottest development news presented as a feed. Although it might look simple on the surface, behind it, there's an entire engine. To generate a feed, three main processes happen:

1. Collection
2. Ranking
3. Filtering

Let's learn more about each one of these processes.

## How are the articles collected?

We collect articles from more than 400 content sources. A content source can be a tech magazine, publication, blog, or developer blogging platform. It might surprise you, but it's so simple. We collect the article through RSS feeds publicly provided by the qualified sources of daily.dev. Once every few minutes, we check for new pieces in the RSS feeds, and if found, we add them to daily.dev.

At the current scale of our platform, just being picked doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to get traffic. Once your article is picked up by daily.dev, it means it's on our feed, but it might be in a high or low position. Obviously, the higher an article is ranked, the more exposure it will get. If you're interested in learning how the ranking works, keep reading.

If you're running a publication aiming to distribute content relevant for developers, please read our [content guidelines](https://daily.dev/support/content-guidelines) to learn more about our new source requests review process.

## How are the articles ranked?

Ranking changes based on the feed that the user is watching. There are four feeds on daily.dev, and each feed has its ranking logic:

1. Popular Feed (Default)
2. Upvoted Feed
3. Discussed Feed
4. Recent Feed

To learn more, please visit our [Default Feeds guide](/default-feeds).

## How does the filtering work?

That's a great question! Once we've collected and ranked articles, the last process is to filter them. Filtering is our way to help you personalize your feed according to your specific interests. By applying certain filters on your feed, daily.dev will super-charge it with relevant content! 

The easiest way to start is by using the sidebar to choose tags you want to follow, and the feed will automatically curate relevant content accordingly.
