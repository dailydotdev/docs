# Reputation explained

## Reputation is entirely optional

The most important activities on daily.dev are reading the latest dev news, upvoting and commenting. None of which require you to have any reputation. 

:::tip
If youâ€™re new to daily.dev, we recommend to first spend time in [setting up your feed.](../setting-up-your-feed/filtering-content-feed.md) Once you get comfortable with your feed settings, go ahead, and expand your participation in other areas.

## What is reputation?

**Reputation is how we measure how much the community trusts you.** It is earned by receiving positive feedback (such as upvotes) from other community members on comments you post and posts you write that are picked up by our feed. 

The more reputation you earn, the more privileges you will gain and the more tools you'll have access to on daily.dev. That is intentional. We donâ€™t run this site; the community does! Although specific privileges have not been announced yet, we encourage you to start building your reputation on the platform, as your points are **publicly visible on your profile.** 

## How do I earn reputation points?
On 24th April 2022 we changed the way we calculated your reputation, the table below explains how we calculate your score currently (and the old scores for reference):

| Reputation Area | Old Scoring | **New Scoring** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A post you wrote/scouted is upvoted* | 1 | **10** |
| A post you wrote/scouted is banned* | N / A | **-100** |
| A comment you wrote is upvoted | 1 | **50** |
| You report a post and it is approved by a moderator and removed | 1 | **100** |
| You suggest a new source that is approved and added to the daily.dev feed! ðŸŽ‰ | N / A | **200** |
| Your comment gets featured (deprecated) | 2 | **N / A** |

 \* In order to gain or lose reputation from writing a post, the post must be attributed to you and show in your posts list on your profile. Also, please note that only upvotes from developers with more than 250 reputation points will count for the purpose of gaining reputation.  

### What counts towards reputation?
We introduced a system where you only receive reputation from an upvote on your post or comment if the person who **casts that upvote** has at least 250 reputation. 

This ensures that people can't just add a new account and upvote their own post; only genuine users' votes are counted!

### Starting reputation and minimum reputation
Finally we changed the starting and minimum reputation.

The starting reputation used to be 1 point; we have changed it to 10 points to keep it inline with our new scoring.

Additionally it is not possible to get a negative reputation anymore. So reputation will never drop below 0!


## Useful comments are the best and easiest way to gain points!
We love comments that help others decide if a post is for them, support the author or offer valuable feedback.

Here are a few tips on how you can make your comments better:
* Try to help other users extract new insights from the post youâ€™re commenting on
* Write summaries so that other users can save time reading through the whole post
* Warn if thereâ€™s a professional mistake in a post
* Make a funny dev rant
* Anything else you have in mind, as long as it is respectful and valuable
