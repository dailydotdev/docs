# Blocking and Report

Customizing your daily.dev feed is simple. When there are specific tags or sources you don’t want to see, blocking them comes in handy.

Watch this quick overview video to see how to block sources and tags for a more tailored feed experience:

## How Does Blocking Work?

Blocking enables you to:

1. Remove all posts containing a [specific tag](#blocking-tags): Eliminate unwanted content by blocking tags that don’t match your interests.
2. Remove all posts from a [specific source](#blocking-sources): Keep your feed free from sources you prefer not to follow.

:::info
Blocking only applies to posts in your "My Feed." It does not affect content in the Popular, Most Upvoted, or Best Discussions feeds.

Set up your personal feed for optimal use of the blocking feature. Customize your daily.dev experience to suit your preferences and enjoy a curated feed.

## Blocking Tags and Sources from the Feed

Blocking tags and sources can be done directly from the feed. Whenever you see a post with a tag or source you wish to block, click on the more options button (⋮) (1):
