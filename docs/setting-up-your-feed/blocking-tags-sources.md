# Blocking tags and sources

Adjusting your feed is designed to be straightforward. But sometimes, there are specific tags or sources that you just don't want to see at all. This is where blocking plays an important role. 

Watch the quick overview video to quickly get familiar with blocking sources and tags.

## How does blocking work?

Blocking allows you to:
1. Remove all articles that contain a [specific tag](#blocking-tags) 
2. Remove all articles that come from a [specific source](#blocking-sources) 

:::info
Blocking is only applied to articles that are displayed on the "**My Feed**" feed

Blocking a tag does not affect the content on the:

- Popular feed
- Most Upvoted feed 
- Best Discussions feed 

These feeds will still show articles with tags that you have blocked. 

To take full advantage of the blocking features, please [set up your personal feed](../key-features/feeds.md).

### Blocking tags

Tags can have the following states:
* Following / Not following

Once clicked, the blocked tags and sources will be removed from your feed.

You will also see a toast notification confirming you have blocked a tag or source. 

If you have blocked a tag or source by mistake you can click "Undo" in the toast to reverse the action.
