# Advanced Filtering

Take complete control over your daily.dev experience with advanced filtering options. Fine-tune content categories, sources, and language preferences beyond basic tag selection.

## Why Advanced Filtering?

Tags provide broad topic filtering, but content categories offer granular control over the types of posts you see. Filter by post format, content style, and language to create the perfect developer feed.

## Tag Management

Access **Feed Settings** to manage your tag preferences with two options:

- **Follow all** - Automatically include new relevant tags as they're added
- **Custom selection** - Choose specific tags by expanding tag groups
