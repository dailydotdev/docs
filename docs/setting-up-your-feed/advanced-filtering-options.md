# Advanced filtering

Unlock the full potential of your daily.dev feed with advanced content filtering options based on content categories.

## What are the advanced filtering options?

Why settle for basic filtering based on tags when you can have more control over your feed? Sometimes, posts may contain tags that you follow, but the content might not be exactly what you're looking for. That's where configuring your feed based on content categories can come in handy, as content categories are treated separately from the tags you follow.

## Configure your content categories

Click on the "My Feed" filter button to open the feed options menu, as shown below:

Choose "Advanced" from the feed filters menu, as illustrated below:

Once on the Advanced menu, you'll have access to several on/off toggle switches that allow you to fine-tune your feed based on your preferences. These options include:

| Category                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Showcases             | Show posts that aim to showcase a project or contain predominently code snippets. These posts usually provide a demo-only of the showcased work without broader context around it.                                                             |
| Tech magazines        | Show tech news posts not directly related to programming but still focused on tech. For example, reports about tech companies, startups, venture capital, and scientific discoveries.                                                          |
