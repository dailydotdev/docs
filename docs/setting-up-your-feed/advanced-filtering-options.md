# Advanced filtering

Unlock the full potential of your daily.dev feed with advanced content filtering options based on content categories.

## What are the advanced filtering options?

Why settle for basic filtering based on tags when you can have more control over your feed? Sometimes, posts may contain tags that you follow, but the content might not be exactly what you're looking for. That's where configuring your feed based on content categories can come in handy, as content categories are treated separately from the tags you follow.

## Configure your tags

To configure your tags, click on the "Feed Settings" button to open the feed options menu, as shown below:

You can decide to follow all the tags or only the tags you're interested in. To do this, click on the "Follow all" button to follow all tags or expand the secton clicking on the > icon on the left of the Tag group to follow only the tags you're interested in (see the picture below)
