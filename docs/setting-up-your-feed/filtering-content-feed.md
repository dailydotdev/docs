# Creating a personal feed

Welcome to daily.dev's personal feed feature called "My feed"! With our personal feed, you can customize the content you see, making sure it's tailored to your interests. Here's a simple guide on how to create your own personal feed.


## Step 1: Sign Up

Start by signing up for an account. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to create your profile. By signing up, you'll have access to additional features such as bookmarking posts, customizing settings, and syncing your feed across multiple devices.


## Step 2: Choose Tag Categories

Tag categories are the building blocks of your personal feed. They help you specify the topics and types of content you want to see in your feed. During the onboarding process, you'll be prompted to choose from a list of tag categories that are might be relevant to your interests. Don't worry if you're not sure what tags to choose initially, as you can always fine-tune them later. You will see a button at the bottom that helps you preview your feed after you have chosen five topics.

## Step 3: Fine-Tune Your Tags

After signing up, you can further customize your personal feed by fine-tuning your tag categories. You can easily add or remove tags based on your changing interests or preferences. This way, you can ensure that the content you see in your feed is always relevant and up-to-date.

To access this menu hit the "My feed" button that's placed above the first card on your feed.

You can adjust settings such as content types (e.g., non-editorial content, newsletters, product launches, etc.), and more. These advanced filtering options allow you to have more control over the content that appears in your feed, ensuring that it meets your specific needs.
