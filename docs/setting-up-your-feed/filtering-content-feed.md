# Creating a Personal Feed

Transform daily.dev into your personalized developer news hub with "My Feed." Customize content based on your technologies and interests for maximum relevance.

## Tag Selection

Tag categories are the foundation of your personalized experience. Choose technologies, programming languages, and topics that match your development interests.

:::tip
Don't worry about perfect tag selection initially - you can always adjust your preferences later as your interests evolve.

## Setup Process

### 1. Account Creation
Create your daily.dev profile to unlock personalization features including [bookmarks](key-features/bookmarks.md), cross-device sync, and custom feed settings.

### 2. Tag Refinement  
Fine-tune your tag preferences anytime by clicking the **My Feed** button above your first post card. Add or remove tags as your interests change.
