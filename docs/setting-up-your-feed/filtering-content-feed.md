# Creating a personal feed

Welcome to daily.dev's personal feed feature called "My feed"! With our personal feed, you can customize the content you see, making sure it's tailored to your interests. Here's a simple guide on how to create your own personal feed.

## Step 1: Choose Tag Categories

Tag categories are the building blocks of your personal feed. They help you specify the topics and types of content you want to see in your feed. During the onbaording process, you'll be prompted to choose from a list of tag categories that are might be relevant to your interests. Don't worry if you're not sure what tags to choose initially, as you can always fine-tune them later.
