# Filtering content

daily.dev is designed to help you stay up to date with minimal effort.

For this reason, **filtering your feed is probably the most powerful feature of daily.dev**. 


:::info
Tags you choose and tags you block only affect "My Feed". 

They **do not** affect the other feeds: 
- Popular
- Most Upvoted
- Best discussions
:::


## Setting up your feed

To set up your tags for the first time, click on the "Choose Tags" button at the top of the page (1).
