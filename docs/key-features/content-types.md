Here are the different types of content that you can find::

## Articles

Articles have been the first type of content that daily.dev has supported: You can read articles from your favorite tech blogs and news sites.

Some examples: freeCodeCamp, DEV, Vercel, and many others.

Remember that to have a better experience, you can filter the content that you want to see, by setting up your feed: [Set up your feed](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/setting-up-your-feed/filtering-content-feed)

### How are Articles formed?

When our search engine detects a post that is an article, it’s automatically grouped into one post/card, with a brief summary of the article (called TLDR: Too Long Didn't Read).

### What can you do with Articles?

You can like, comment, upvote, and share the articles with your friends, (for example in a squad or on social media) and you can also read the original article by clicking on the card.

Ah and you can also save the article to read it later, by clicking on the bookmark icon.

To read more about it, check the [Bookmarks section](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/bookmarks#importance-of-bookmarks) documentation.

### What if I don't like an article, or I think it's inappropriate?

If you don't like an article, you can downvote it, and it will be removed from your feed. You can also report it if you think it's inappropriate.

## Squads posts

A post on a squad is not that different from an usual post, and it can also go on the main feed. The difference is that it will also be visible to the members of the squad.

### What is a Squad?

A Squad is a group where you and other developers can come together to learn and interact on topics that matter to you. You can think of Squads like any other online group but geared specifically towards developers.

On Squads, you can share knowledge, ask questions, and engage in discussions, all within a private group of your peers.

## Collections

Another type, the newset one, is the Collections.

They are an AI-powered feature that groups together all the news that has come out on the same topic from multiple sources and creates a concise, complete summary of what’s going on.

![daily.dev collections](https://github.com/dailydotdev/docs/assets/18360871/71a4b3ea-16f8-427a-804a-7f57589e78bd)

### How do you recognize a Collection?

Collections are marked with a special label, so you can easily recognize them.

![daily.dev collections](https://github.com/dailydotdev/docs/assets/18360871/cdc18716-7b60-4b36-a958-47d3bfc6bfa8)

Original? No. Effective? Yes.

### How are Collections formed?

When our content engine detects two or more posts that talk about the same topic, they’re automatically grouped into one post/card, with a brief summary of the topic.

Collections take all the news that has come out on the same topic from multiple sources and creates a concise, complete summary of what’s going on. As new articles come out, the Collection is updated so that it gives you the latest overview of everything you need to know.

- If you want to read more, Collections display the sources they’re based on, so that you can read the original.

- You can subscribe to a collection for a notification every time it’s updated so that you always know the latest!
