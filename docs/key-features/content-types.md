## Articles

Articles have been the first type of content that daily.dev has supported. 

You can read articles from your favorite tech blogs and news sites.

Remember to [Set up your feed](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/setting-up-your-feed/filtering-content-feed)

### How are Articles formed?

When our search engine detects a post that is an article, it‚Äôs automatically grouped into one post/card, with a brief summary of the article.

### Can I turn off the Articles in my feed?

Sure! Just click the ‚Äúmore options‚Äù button on any article card/post and select `Don't show posts from Articles`.

### Can I see all Articles similar to all Community Picks?

Of course, you just check The [Community Picks posts](https://app.daily.dev/sources/community)!

To know more about Community Picks, please check The [Community Picks section](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/community-picks)

## Videos

daily.dev now supports videos!

Yes, you heard it right: you can now watch videos from top-class tech YouTubers, directly on your feed!

The cool part is that you can watch the videos directly on the daily.dev feed, without having to leave the app, how cool is that? :D

Apart from that, you can still have the daily.dev experience of liking, commenting, and sharing the videos with your friends, for example in a squad!

## Squads posts

A Squad is a group where you and other developers can come together to learn and interact on topics that matter to you. You can think of Squads like any other online group but geared specifically towards developers.

On Squads, you can share knowledge, ask questions, and engage in discussions, all within a private group of your peers.

A post on a squad is not that different from an usual post, and it can also go on the main feed. The difference is that it will also be visible to the members of the squad.

For more details, please check the [Squads documentation](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/squads/creating-your-squad).

## Collections

 Want to get the latest tech news and drama but tired of sifting through countless posts? Well, now you can go through our collections feature! :)

### How are Collections formed?

When our search engine detects two or more posts that talk about the same topic, they‚Äôre automatically grouped into one post/card, with a brief summary of the topic.

Collections take all the news that has come out on the same topic from multiple sources and creates a concise, complete summary of what‚Äôs going on. As new articles come out, the Collection is updated so that it gives you the latest overview of everything you need to know.

üí° If you want to read more, Collections display the sources they‚Äôre based on, so that you can read the original.

üí° You can also subscribe to a collection for a notification every time it‚Äôs updated so that you always know the latest.
