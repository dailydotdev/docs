## Best Practices for daily.dev Search

Getting the most accurate and useful information from daily.dev Search often comes down to how well you craft your query. If you've ever wished for a search engine that speaks "Developer," you're in the right place. Here are some pro tips to supercharge your queries and get even more precise and relevant results.

### 1. Jargon is Your Friend Here

You're among developers, so feel free to talk like one. If you have a technical term or a piece of jargon that will make your query more precise, go ahead and use it.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "Optimize server-side rendering in React"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "How to optimize SSR hydration in React?"

### 2. Go Long-Tail for Niche Queries

Contrary to most search advice, getting super specific can actually improve the quality of your search results on daily.dev. If you have a niche question or topic, go ahead and make your query as detailed as you like.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "Vue.js state management"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "How do I manage local state in a Vue.js 3 composition API?"

### 3. Keep It Single-Task Focused

It's better to have a single, well-focused query than a multi-pronged question. This keeps our AI on point and gives you the most relevant information for what you're specifically asking about.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "Compare Python and Ruby for web development and latest security vulnerabilities"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "How does Python compare to Ruby for web development?" *Then* "What are the latest security vulnerabilities in Python/Ruby?" 

### 4. Use Keywords, But Don't Be Shy About Context

While keywords are the bedrock of search queries, don't shy away from providing a bit more context if it makes your query clearer.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "React state"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "What are the best practices for managing state in React?"

### 5. Questions Are Welcome

Good newsâ€”our search engine loves questions! Phrasing your queries as questions can lead to more focused and accurate results.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "JavaScript async updates"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "What are the latest updates on async in JavaScript?"

### 6. Not ChatGPT for Developers: We Find, We Don't Write

It might be tempting to use daily.dev Search as a content generator for things like blog posts or technical documentation. However, it's essential to understand that our wheelhouse is in finding the developer-related information you need. We don't generate original content like blog posts or technical documents.

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "Write a blog post about React Hooks"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "Best practices for using React Hooks"

ðŸš« **Not Recommended**: "Generate technical documentation for my Python code"  
âœ… **Recommended**: "Python technical documentation guidelines"

:::tip
In essence, daily.dev Search is your trusty companion for discovering the coding resources you require, but we're not the tool to create those resources from scratch. So, for all your finding needs, we're here; for your creating needs, there are other specialized platforms. Happy searching!

By putting these best practices to work, you can get the most out of daily.dev Search, making it easier than ever to find exactly what you're looking for. So go ahead, ask us anything! Well, almost anything. ðŸ¤“

## The Fine Print

Please note that while we've worked hard to make daily.dev Search as accurate and helpful as possible, it still utilizes AI and Large-Laguage Models (LLMs) at its core. That means it might not always get everything 100% right. If you find something that seems off or unclear, we encourage you to double-check with other trusted sources. Your feedback is invaluable to us, especially as we're still in the beta phase. Thank you for understanding and for being a part of our community!
