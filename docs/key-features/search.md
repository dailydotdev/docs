# Search

daily.dev’s search is your go-to way to explore the platform. Whether you’re looking for a specific post, a trusted source, trending tags, or other developers — it’s all just a few keystrokes away.

:::info
We’ve sunset our AI-powered search due to low adoption. Like any good startup experiment, it taught us a lot. We're using those learnings to build even better experiences ahead — stay tuned.

## What you can search for

Here’s what you can search for using the search bar at the top of the page or via <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>:

### Content (posts)
- Instantly search for posts matching your query.
- Results are sorted by relevance, helping you discover tutorials, news, comparisons, product launches, and more.

### Tags
- If your search term matches a tag, it’ll appear with a hashtag (e.g. `#react`).
- Clicking it takes you to a dedicated tag page sorted by:
  1. Top-voted posts  
  2. Best discussions  
  3. Everything else

### Sources
- Looking for content from a specific blog, newsletter, or YouTube channel? Search for the source name.
- Sources appear with a custom icon. Clicking opens the source page with the latest posts, ordered by engagement.

### Users
- Search by handle or name to find developers on daily.dev.
- Discover their activity, Squads, reading streaks, and shared posts.

### Squads
- Search for Squads by name or topic.
- Join and engage with communities that match your interests.

## Search results view

We’ve revamped the search interface to give you a cleaner, faster way to find what matters. When you search, you’ll see:

- **Main column:** Relevant posts
- **Right sidebar:** Matching tags, sources, and Squads
- **Lower section:** Developers who have mentioned the term

Everything is just a scroll away — no extra clicks needed.

## Tips for better results

- Use specific keywords (e.g. `vite vs webpack`, not just `bundler`)
- Try searching by tag (e.g. `#typescript`) for broader discovery
- Looking for people? Use their handle or full name

## What’s next

We’re not done. Search is a core pillar of the daily.dev experience, and we’re constantly evolving it. Future updates will bring smarter filtering, better personalization, and even deeper integration into your developer journey.
