## How are Collections formed?

When our search engine detects two or more posts that talk about the same topic, they’re automatically grouped into one post/card, with a brief summary of the topic.

## Can I turn off the Collections in my feed?

Sure! Just click the “more options” button on any collection card/post and select `Don't show posts from Collections`.

## Can I see all Collections similar to all Community Picks?

Of course! :)  Check our [feed exclusively for Collection posts](https://app.daily.dev/sources/collections).

## Can I see all the Collections that I'm subscribed to?

Currently, there’s no feature to view a list of collections to which you’re subscribed.

## Help us think of more features
