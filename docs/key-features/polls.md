# Polls

## What are polls?

Polls are an interactive post type on daily.dev that allow users to create multiple-choice questions and gather community opinions with a single click. They provide a frictionless way to engage with the developer community and collect structured feedback on various topics.

Each poll includes:
- 2–4 answer options
- One-click voting mechanism
- Real-time results with vote counts and percentages
- 7-day active voting period
- Full integration with daily.dev's commenting, upvoting, and sharing features

Polls enable quick participation without requiring detailed written responses.

## Why use polls?

Polls offer several benefits for community engagement:

1. **Low-effort participation**: Vote with a single click without needing to write detailed responses
2. **Instant gratification**: See immediate results and community sentiment
3. **Structured feedback**: Generate clear, queryable data compared to freeform comments
4. **Community insights**: Discover what the developer community thinks about specific topics
5. **Discussion starters**: Use poll results as a foundation for deeper conversations

## How to create a poll

### Starting a new poll

1. Click the "+" button or "Create Post" button in your feed
2. Select "Create Poll" from the options
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Question**: Write your poll question (be clear and specific)
   - **Answer options**: Add 2–4 possible answers
- **Audience**: Choose to post to everyone or a specific Squad

### Poll creation tips

- **Keep questions clear**: Write concise, unambiguous questions
- **Provide balanced options**: Ensure answer choices cover the likely range of opinions
- **Use relevant tags**: Help users find polls related to their interests
- **Consider your audience**: Tailor the question complexity to your intended audience

## How to participate in polls

### Voting in polls

Polls appear directly in your feed with a distinct visual layout:

1. **Identify poll posts**: Look for the "Poll" label in the top-left of the card
2. **Read the question**: Review the poll question and available options
3. **Cast your vote**: Click on your preferred answer option
4. **View results**: After voting, see the percentage breakdown and vote counts for all options

### Important voting details

- **One vote per poll**: You can only vote once, and votes cannot be changed
- **Anonymous voting**: Your individual vote choice is private
- **Login required**: You must be logged in to vote
- **Results visibility**: Vote counts and percentages are only visible after you vote

## Poll lifecycle

### Active polls (First 7 days)

- Users can vote and see results immediately after voting
- Comments, upvotes, bookmarks, and shares work normally
- Poll creator and voters receive engagement notifications

### Expired polls (After 7 days)

- Voting is automatically disabled
- Results remain permanently visible to all users
- Commenting and other interactions continue to work
- Final results notifications are sent to the creator and all voters

## Engaging with poll results

### Post-vote discussions

After voting, consider engaging further:

- **Comment on results**: Share why you voted a particular way
- **Discuss surprising outcomes**: Engage when results don't match your expectations
- **Ask follow-up questions**: Use poll results to spark deeper conversations
- **Share insights**: Provide context or expertise related to the poll topic

### Using poll data

Poll results can inform:
- **Technology decisions**: See what tools the community prefers
- **Industry trends**: Understand emerging patterns in development
- **Learning priorities**: Discover what skills other developers value
- **Community sentiment**: Gauge opinions on controversial topics

## Poll notifications

You'll receive notifications for:

### As a poll creator
- When your poll receives votes
- When someone comments on your poll
- When your poll expires (final results summary)

### As a poll participant
- When a poll you voted in expires (final results)
- When there's significant activity on polls you've engaged with

## Content preferences

Like other post types, you can customize your poll experience:

1. Go to your **Content Preferences** settings
2. Find the **Content Types** section
3. Toggle polls on or off based on your preferences
4. Adjust frequency settings if you want to see fewer or more polls

## Best practices

### For poll creators

- **Ask relevant questions**: Focus on topics that interest the developer community
- **Provide context**: Include background information when helpful
- **Engage with voters**: Respond to comments and explain your reasoning
- **Follow up**: Share insights or conclusions based on the results

### For poll participants

- **Vote thoughtfully**: Consider your answer carefully, as you can't change it
- **Explain your choice**: Use comments to provide context for your vote
- **Respect different opinions**: Remember that polls reveal diverse community perspectives
- **Stay engaged**: Return to see final results and ongoing discussions

## Moderation and quality

Polls follow the same community guidelines as other posts:

- Report inappropriate or spam polls using the report function
- Polls are subject to the same content moderation policies
- Community members can upvote high-quality polls and downvote poor ones
- Rate limiting applies to poll creation just like regular posts

Polls represent a new way to engage with the daily.dev community, offering structured interaction that complements existing discussion formats while providing valuable insights into developer opinions and trends.
