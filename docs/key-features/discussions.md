# Discussions

## What is a discussion?

Discussions are a valuable way to engage with the professional developer community on daily.dev and share insights on various topics.

As a professional network for developers, we highly value the opportunity for our community members to participate in public discussions. Discussions allow you to share your thoughts, insights, and experiences related to a post or topic and contribute to the community's collective knowledge.
