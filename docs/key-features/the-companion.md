![Companion Widget Cover Image](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1655796433/companion/chagelog_cover.png)

The companion widget allows you to [upvote](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/upvotes),
[comment](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/discussions), and
[bookmark](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/bookmarks) posts directly on the post page
itself!

## Activating the Companion

Getting started with the companion widget is easy!

1. On the daily.dev extension, open a new tab and look for the purple button in the top right next
   to your profile picture.
2. If you don't see the purple button, go to the
   [extension store](https://api.daily.dev/get?_ga=2.220083545.157894557.1655794404-623033389.1647175282)
   and download the latest version of the daily.dev extension.
3. Click on the purple button located at the top right of your screen next to your profile picture
   to add the companion.
4. You will be asked for additional permissions. These permissions are only required so we can check
   the page that you are on is in our feed and so we can inject the companion widget into the page. 
5. Once you accept the permissions, you should be redirected to a
   [page about the companion](https://daily.dev/blog/companion).

## Privacy and Data Usage

We collect minimal data and no personal data when using the companion widget. Here’s how it works:

- For every page you visit, we dispatch a request containing the URL only to check if it's in the
  daily.dev database.
- If the URL is in the database, the companion is activated, and we track actions like upvotes,
  comments, and bookmarks linked to your user ID.
- Requests are only dispatched on page load, so the companion will not affect page performance.

## What to Do If You Don’t See the Companion Widget

Possible issues:
