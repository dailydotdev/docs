The companion widget allows you to [upvote](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/upvotes), [comment](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/discussions) and [bookmark](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/bookmarks) posts directly on the post page itself!

## Activating the companion
Getting started with the companion widget is easy!

1. On the daily.dev extension, open a new tab and look for the purple button in the top right next to your profile picture
2. If you don't see the purple button, go to the [extension store](https://api.daily.dev/get?_ga=2.220083545.157894557.1655794404-623033389.1647175282) and download the latest version of the daily.dev extension.
3. Click on the purple button located at the top right of your screen next to your profile picture to add the companion
4. You will be asked for additional permissions. These permissions are only required so we can check the page that you are on is in our feed and so we can inject the companion widget into the page.¬†
5. Once you accept the permissions you should be redirected to a [page about the companion](https://daily.dev/blog/companion).¬†

## Privacy and data usage
We collect minimal data and no personal data when using the companion. However we do need to send a couple of bits of information to our servers to make the companion work.

- For every page you visit, we dispatch a request that contains the URL you visit. 
- This URL is not saved anywhere and is only used to check whether the page you are viewing is in the daily.dev database. 
- If the URL is not in the daily.dev database, this is where the process stops. 
- If the URL is in the daily.dev database then the companion is activated. 
- When the companion is activated we track product usage events such as upvotes, comments and bookmarks along with some usage data that are required to operate the daily.dev site and link the companion to the main feed. We also pass your daily.dev userID to link upvotes to your account.
- Please note, all requests are only dispatched on page load, so the Companion will not interfere with the performance of any page you visit.

## What do I do if I don't see the Companion Widget?
There are a couple of possible causes:
### 1. You are running an older version of the daily.dev extension. 
Your version should be at least v3.16.4)

Please visit the [extension store](https://api.daily.dev/get?_ga=2.190141803.157894557.1655794404-623033389.1647175282) and download the latest version and try again.

### 2. Check your settings
On the daily.dev extension go to the menu item "Customize".

There you will see a section called "preferences". 

You should see a setting at the bottom of that section "Enable companion". Please ensure that is toggled on!
