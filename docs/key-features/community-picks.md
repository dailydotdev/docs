![Sunsetting Community Picks](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1753370633/docs/Sunsetting_community_picks.jpg)

:::info
**Community Picks has been sunset** as of 2025. We've simplified content contribution - anyone can now click **"New Post"** and contribute directly to daily.dev.
:::

## What Were Community Picks?

Community Picks were posts sourced by the community - one of daily.dev's most successful features that allowed developers to directly contribute content they believed in. It was our first real experiment in community involvement, and it became our top content source by every metric that matters.

## What's Changed?

Instead of the separate Community Picks mechanism, **anyone can now click "New Post" and contribute directly**. No extra steps, no abstraction - just direct contribution to the platform.

### Benefits of the New System

- **More credit for your work** - contributions live under your name
- **Better visibility** for your profile
- **Faster path** to grow your following
- **Direct connection** between contributors and content consumers

## Your Previous Community Picks

All content you previously shared through Community Picks is still available on the platform. Simply visit your profile and check the **Posts tab** to see all your contributions.

## How to Contribute Content Now

With the new system, contributing content is simpler than ever:

![New Post Button](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1753370632/docs/cpimage.png)

1. **Click "New Post"** anywhere on daily.dev
2. **Share your content directly** - no separate submission process needed
3. **Build your following** - content is attributed directly to you
4. **Get more exposure** - higher reputation users get increased visibility

### Content Guidelines

Before contributing any content, make sure to familiarize yourself with our [content guidelines](../for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md). These ensure our platform maintains high-quality, relevant, and ethical content standards.

## Following Individual Contributors

Instead of subscribing to Community Picks as a general source, you can now **follow individual contributors** whose content you enjoy. This creates a more personal and precise discovery experience.

## Thank You to Community Picks Contributors

Community Picks wasn't just a feature - it was the foundation that proved community-driven content could thrive on daily.dev. Thank you to everyone who contributed. Your work helped shape what daily.dev is today, and your contributions continue to live on under your profile.
