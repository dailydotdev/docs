# Community Picks

Community Picks are posts that are sourced by the community.

We want you to submit posts that made a real difference to your tech journey. Whether these are
in-depth tutorials, interesting perspectives on tech problems, or well thought out and high-effort
entertainment pieces aimed at developers. Above all, we want posts that you believe need more
exposure, from creators you admire, that you think will benefit the daily.dev developer community.

:::caution Before you embark on submitting your Community Picks, it's crucial to familiarize
yourself with our [content guidelines](../for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md). These
principles are the cornerstone of our content review process and they ensure that our platform
maintains its standard of high-quality, relevant, and ethical content. So, take a moment to read
through these guidelines thoroughly. Doing so will increase your understanding of what we look for
and improve the likelihood of your content being accepted. Your informed contribution can help make
our platform an even more enriching resource for our community. :::

## Community Picks in the daily.dev feed

Community Picks are posts that are added to the daily.dev feed by our community members. These posts
can be from nearly any website / online publication, not just from our pre-qualified sources.

### How can I spot a community pick?

On a card in the feed there is always an icon showing the source in the top left.

![screenshot showing the community picks icon on the top left of a card](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1724397565/docs-v2/f531e2b3-a052-44d2-8bac-311df72e906d.png)

Clicking on this icon will take you to the community picks feed.

### Community Picks feed

All of the posts submitted by the community are available in the
[Community Picks feed.](https://app.daily.dev/sources/community)

![community picks page](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1724397631/docs-v2/03d6da9c-7a30-44aa-9d7d-96e345b5df36.png)

## Submitting / Scouting a Community Pick

We want you to submit posts that made a real difference to your tech journey. Whether they are
in-depth tutorials, interesting perspectives on tech problems, or well thought out and high effort
entertainment pieces aimed at developers.

Above all, we want posts that you believe need more exposure, from authors you admire, that you
believe will benefit the daily.dev developer community.

Low effort, poor quality and (self) promotional content will be removed to ensure a high standard on
the platform.

:::info Before submitting a Community Pick, you should read the
[**content guidelines**](../for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) to ensure your post is
suitable for the feed. :::

### Reputation Requirements

To be able to submit a Community Pick you need to have at least 250 reputation on daily.dev. Once
you reach this threshold you will earn the Scout privilege.

:::tip [Learn how to gain reputation](../your-profile/reputation.md) and how reputation works. :::

If you do not have enough reputation to submit a link you will see a message telling you that you do
not have enough reputation and the submit button will be disabled.

![not enough reputation for community links notification](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a132a66-b4f5-4def-b314-a3f6dd999819)

### How to submit a link

On the menu on the left you will see a section "Contribute" containing a button "Submit link".

Clicking on that button will open the "Submit link" modal.

This is how the modal looks like

![Submit modal example](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1724397819/docs-v2/e8d2da79-6da6-47b8-9b1a-d974f512df6b.png)

Here you can paste in the post URL and then press submit.

You will then see either a success, already exists or error message.

:::caution Please note that **submitting your own articles is not allowed.** Please share amazing
articles from other authors that you have enjoyed. If you're looking for ways to post your own
content please refer to our ["How to get featured?"](../for-content-creators/how-to-get-featured.md)
guide. :::

#### Post already exists

If the post already exists in the daily.dev feed you will see a message explaining the post already
exists and a link to that post.

### Successful Submissions

If the post you submitted has a valid URL and doesn't already exist you will get a confirmation that
you will be notified by an in-app notification and an email about the request status.

### Rejection Scenarios

There are multiple reasons why a submission to Community Picks could fail.

| We ran into a problem adding this post, our team is looking into it.                                                                                  | This is a generic fallback which normally displays when our crawler could not extract some key information such as the title of the post                                             |
| This post is already on daily.dev!                                                                                                                    | If you manage to submit a post at the same time as someone else it may be possible that the post will exist once we come to process it and so you will receive this message          |
| The post you submitted is written by an author who violated our community guidelines and is banned. We no longer accept submissions from this author. | It is rare we ban authors, but occasionally they consistently post spammy or NSFW content that is not suitable for daily.dev. We will not accept any posts written by these authors. |
| You canâ€™t submit your own posts as community picks, please suggest posts by other people.                                                             | Community Picks are not designed for self promotion, instead try submitting posts written by others that you think will benefit the community.                                       |
| The post you submitted is behind a paywall, so we cannot add it to the daily.dev feed.                                                                | We try our best to make sure all posts shared are free for the community. If we detect a paywall then a post will not be accepted for the feed.                                      |
| There was an error and we were unable to gather the required information from the URL submitted to add it to our feed.                                | If a site has an unusual structure our crawler may not be able to parse the page correctly to create the tags and TLDR.                                                              |
