## Finding Community Picks

Community Picks appear throughout daily.dev alongside content from our curated sources. They're sourced from any website or publication - not limited to our pre-qualified sources.

### Identification
Look for the Community Picks icon in the top-left corner of post cards. Click this icon to access the dedicated Community Picks feed.

#### Post already exists
If the post already exists in the daily.dev feed you will see a message explaining the post already exists and a link to that post.

### Successful Submissions
If the post you submitted has a valid URL and doesn't already exist you will get a confirmation that you will be notified by an in-app notification and an email about the request status.

### Rejection Scenarios
There are multiple reasons why a submission to Community Picks could fail.

#### Before submission
| Message | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| You do not have sufficient permissions and or reputation to submit a link to Community Picks yet. | You need 250 reputation and to have not received a ban from posting Community Picks in order to be able to submit a link |
| You can only submit 3 links per day and have reached your limit. Please try again tomorrow. | None |
| The URL you submitted is not valid, please check and try again. | Please include the full url including "https://" etc. when submitting a link |
| This post has previously appeared in the daily.dev feed but was deleted and cannot be added to the feed again. | We may delete posts that do not meet our content guidelines. Once a post has been deleted it cannot be added to the daily.dev feed again |

#### After submission (via email)
| Failure reason | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| We ran into a problem adding this post, our team is looking into it. | This is a generic fallback which normally displays when our crawler could not extract some key information such as the title of the post | 
| This post is already on daily.dev! | If you manage to submit a post at the same time as someone else it may be possible that the post will exist once we come to process it and so you will receive this message |
| The post you submitted is written by an author who violated our community guidelines and is banned. We no longer accept submissions from this author. | It is rare we ban authors, but occasionally they consistently post spammy or NSFW content that is not suitable for daily.dev. We will not accept any posts written by these authors. |
| You can’t submit your own posts as community picks, please suggest posts by other people. | Community Picks are not designed for self promotion, instead try submitting posts written by others that you think will benefit the community. |
| The post you submitted is behind a paywall, so we cannot add it to the daily.dev feed. | We try our best to make sure all posts shared are free for the community. If we detect a paywall then a post will not be accepted for the feed. |
| There was an error and we were unable to gather the required information from the URL submitted to add it to our feed. | If a site has an unusual structure our crawler may not be able to parse the page correctly to create the tags and TLDR. |
