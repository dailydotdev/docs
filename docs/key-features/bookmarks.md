# Bookmarks

## Why are bookmarks important

Bookmarks are a powerful tool in daily.dev that allow you to save and organize posts for later reference. They provide a convenient way to keep track of interesting posts that you want to read at your own pace, asynchronously. With bookmarks, you can easily curate a personalized reading list and stay up-to-date with the latest insights and information.

### Benefits of using bookmarks
1. Save posts for later: If you come across an interesting post that you don't have time to read immediately, you can simply bookmark it for later. This way, you can easily access it whenever you have the time and inclination to read it, without losing track of it in the flood of information.
2. Organize your reading list: Bookmarks help you stay organized by allowing you to categorize and prioritize posts based on your interests, preferences, or professional needs. You can create folders or tags to easily sort and locate your saved posts, making it convenient to manage your reading list.
3. Sync across devices and browsers: One of the key advantages of using bookmarks in daily.dev is that they sync across devices and browsers. This means that you can save a post on one device or browser and access it from any other device or browser where you are logged in with the same account. This makes it seamless to switch between devices and continue reading where you left off.
4. Personalize your content consumption: By bookmarking posts that are most relevant to your interests and needs, you can create a curated reading list that is tailored to your preferences. This allows you to consume content that is most valuable to you, helping you stay focused on topics that matter the most in your professional development.

## How to bookmark a post?

You can save posts to your bookmarks in daily.dev using multiple methods:
* Clicking on the share button: On every post in the feed, you can click on the share button and then select "Save to bookmarks" to add the post to your bookmarks.
