## Syncing Across Devices

Public mode creates a public RSS feed of your bookmarks for easy sharing or integration. For instance, you can integrate bookmarks with your GitHub README. Follow the tutorial below to set it up.

## [Tutorial] Share Bookmarks on GitHub

### Integrating daily.dev Bookmarks with GitHub

- In the bookmarks section, choose **Share Bookmarks**.
- Activate public mode and copy the RSS feed link.
- On GitHub, create a repository with the same name as your account.
- Create a `.github` folder, then add a `workflows` folder within it.
- Add a file named `daily.dev-bookmarks.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: daily.dev Bookmarks
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every hour
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  daily-dev-bookmarks:
    name: Update this repo's README with latest bookmarks from daily.dev
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow@master
        with:
          comment_tag_name: "daily.dev BOOKMARKS"
          feed_list: "<YOUR BOOKMARKS RSS FEED LINK HERE>"


**Important:** You need to replace the `<YOUR BOOKMARKS RSS FEED LINK HERE>` with your own RSS feed.
