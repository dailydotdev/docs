# Upvotes & Downvotes

The voting system on daily.dev empowers the community to surface quality content while providing feedback to improve the platform's recommendation engine. Vote to help other developers discover valuable content.

:::info
You can vote either up or down on each post, but not both. This ensures voting integrity and accurate community signals.

## Why Voting Matters

**Algorithm feedback** - Help the recommendation engine surface the most valuable content for the community

**Creator recognition** - Acknowledge authors and content creators for their excellent work

**Community curation** - Signal to other developers which content is worth their time

**Personalized experience** - Downvotes privately improve your feed while upvotes boost content visibility

## How to Vote

### Upvoting
Click the **upvote button** (bottom-left of post cards) to show appreciation for quality content. Your vote helps surface valuable posts to the community.

### Downvoting  
Access downvote through the **more options menu** on any post card. Select "downvote" to privately signal content that didn't add value to your experience.
