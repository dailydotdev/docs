# Upvotes

## What is an upvote? 

An upvote is a common method used in community-driven products to allow users to signal their approval or support for a post. It helps move a post towards the top of the feed and serves as a measure of how many people approve of the content.

## Upvoting in daily.dev

In daily.dev, upvotes are a great way to support posts and show appreciation for the work of others. If you find a post helpful, it's highly encouraged to upvote it for several reasons:

1. It helps the feed algorithm understand that the community approves of the post, enabling us to show the most interesting posts to our community.
2. It gives recognition to content creators for their hard work in creating content.
3. It signals to other community members that a post is interesting, saving them time and effort in finding engaging posts to read.
