# Upvotes & Downvotes

Upvotes and downvotes are essential tools in community-driven products, allowing users to express approval or disapproval for a post. This voting system promotes quality content, pushing the best to the forefront, while helping daily.dev refine its recommendation engine to serve users better.

:::info
Keep in mind that you can only select either upvote or downvote for a post—not both. This ensures the integrity and accuracy of our voting system.

## Upvoting in daily.dev

On daily.dev, upvotes acknowledge the quality of posts, show support, and express appreciation for the work of others. Here's why upvoting is highly encouraged:

1. It helps the feed algorithm understand community-approved content, enabling us to show the most interesting posts to our community.
2. It gives recognition to content creators for their hard work.
3. It signals to other community members that a post is engaging, saving them time in finding valuable content.

## Downvoting in daily.dev

Downvotes indicate that you didn’t find a post helpful or interesting. Here’s why downvoting is important:

1. It provides feedback that enhances our recommendation engine, improving your experience on daily.dev.
2. Although downvote counts are private and not visible to others, each downvote impacts the post’s ranking in the feed.
3. After downvoting, you can take follow-up actions, such as [blocking the source or tags](../setting-up-your-feed/blocking-tags-sources.md) associated with the post or reporting it if you find it inappropriate or irrelevant.

## How to Upvote
