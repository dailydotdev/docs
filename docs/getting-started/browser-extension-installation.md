## Troubleshooting

1. [My Chrome's bookmarks bar is gone. How can I bring it back?](#my-chromes-bookmarks-bar-is-gone-how-can-i-bring-it-back)
2. I want [shortcuts to show on my home page](#adding-custom-shortcuts-to-dailydev), does daily.dev support this?

### My Chrome's bookmarks bar is gone. How can I bring it back?

All you need to do is to enable the `Show Bookmarks Bar` option in your browser. 

There are two ways mentioned below to display the bookmarks bar in Google Chrome:

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

Below are the shortcut keys that you can use to toggle the bookmarks toolbar:

For Windows users: <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

For Mac users: <kbd>CMD⌘</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT⇧</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>

#### Using Chrome's Settings Menu

Click on the three dots (⠇) on the top right corner of your Google Chrome browser. 

Go to Bookmarks > Show Bookmarks Bar.

## Adding custom shortcuts to daily.dev

If you are using the daily.dev extension you have the option of adding custom shortcuts to make it easy to access your frequently used sites.

First click on the "Add shortcuts" button (1):

![Add shortcuts button, located towards the top right of your feed](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1663490601/docs-v2/shortcuts-1.jpg)

A modal will appear with the following options:
- My shortcuts (2)
- Most Visited Sites (3)

![Shortcuts modal with "my shortcuts" (2), "Most Visited Sites" (3) and a list of shortcuts below (4)](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1663490601/docs-v2/shortcuts-2.jpg)

By default "My Shortcuts" will be shown. 

If you want to configure your own shortcuts just add the full URL of each site into the list below (4) and then save your changes.

### Importing shortcuts from Chrome
Instead of entering your own shortcuts, you can import your most visited sites from Google Chrome.

Click on "Most Visited Sites" (3) and you will see a second modal informing you that we need more permissions. 

![information about extra permissions needed to be shown in a modal, along with the "next" button (5)](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1663490601/docs-v2/shortcuts-3.jpg)

Click "next" to continue (5) and you will be prompted for extra permissions.

Once you grant those permissions the list of shortcuts (4) will be automatically populated for you!

Once you save and close the modal you will see that the "add shortcuts" button has been replaced with your selected shortcuts! (6)

Click on the three dots (⠇) if you wish to change your shortcuts at any time!
