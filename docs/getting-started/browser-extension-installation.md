:::info
**Note about Firefox Availability:**  
We’ve had to temporarily remove the Firefox extension from the store due to the Mozilla review team’s decision to enforce certain terms. These terms include changes that are partially non-feasible and not reasonable for any app developer to implement, affecting our ability to operate and monetize the app. As a result, Mozilla reverted our extension to an outdated version, making it unusable. We are actively working to find a resolution and appreciate your understanding and patience.

Install the extension and open a new tab to begin.
