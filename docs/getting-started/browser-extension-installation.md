:::info **Note about Firefox Availability:**  
We’ve had to temporarily remove the Firefox extension from the store due to the Mozilla review
team’s decision to enforce certain terms. These terms include changes that are partially
non-feasible and not reasonable for any app developer to implement, affecting our ability to operate
and monetize the app. As a result, Mozilla reverted our extension to an outdated version, making it
unusable. We are actively working to find a resolution and appreciate your understanding and
patience. :::

Just install the extension, open a new tab, and you're all set!
