## The Problem with Traditional Hiring

If you've ever looked for a job, you know the struggle:

- **Job boards**: Apply to dozens of positions and hope someone responds. Often, you're ghosted or filtered out by AI before a human even sees your CV.
- **LinkedIn recruiters**: Endless spam from recruiters who don't understand your stack, sending templated or AI-generated messages that feel impersonal.
- **Lack of respect**: The current hiring process isn't designed for developers. It's built for volume, not for respecting your time and intelligence.

Developers deserve better. That's why we built Career Mode.

## A Developer-First Hiring Experience

Career Mode puts you in control. Unlike traditional job platforms, we've designed an experience by developers, for developers, with three core principles:

### 1. No Recruiter Spam

You won't get any cold DMs from recruiters coming out of the blue trying to poach you or lure you into taking calls. We've eliminated recruiter spam entirely from the platform.

### 2. Private by Default

Whether you're actively looking or happily employed but open to the right opportunity, Career Mode keeps you private. We don't expose you to recruiters until you explicitly say yes to a specific job opportunity.

### 3. High-Quality Matches, Not Another Job Board

We don't want to become another job board where you blindly apply to random positions. Instead, we leverage everything you do on daily.dev—your reading habits, Squad activity, and profile—to deliver curated job matches that truly align with your skills and interests.

## How Career Mode Works

Career Mode operates as a trusted broker between you and employers:

1. **Employers post opportunities** with us (not publicly displayed)
2. **We match jobs to developers** in our network based on skills, interests, and preferences
3. **You receive a notification** when there's a relevant opportunity
4. **You review the job privately** with full transparency about the role, company, and actual hiring team
5. **Double opt-in process**: Both you and the recruiter must say yes
6. **Warm introduction**: We facilitate an email introduction to move the process forward

## Why It's Free Forever

Career Mode is completely free for developers. Always will be. We genuinely believe the developer community deserves a developer-first hiring solution, and we're committed to building that without charging developers.
