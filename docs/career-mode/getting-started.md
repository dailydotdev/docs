## Setting Your Availability Status

When enabling Career Mode, you'll be asked to indicate your availability. This gives our matching system important context about your urgency:

### Actively Looking

Choose this if you're currently searching for a new position. This signals that you're open to conversations and ready to move quickly.

**Best for**:
- Developers actively searching for their next role
- Those ready to interview and potentially switch jobs soon
- Anyone with immediate availability

### Open Only If It's Right

Select this if you're currently employed and happy, but would consider exceptional opportunities.

**Best for**:
- Developers satisfied with their current role
- Those curious about what's available
- Anyone who wants to keep options open without urgency

:::tip
You can change your availability status at any time in Job Preferences. Your status helps us prioritize which opportunities to show you first.

## Quick Setup Checklist

To maximize your chances of receiving high-quality job matches, complete these essential steps:

- [ ] **Enable Career Mode** in Job Preferences
- [ ] **Set your availability status** (actively looking or open if right)
- [ ] **Upload your CV** for better matching accuracy
- [ ] **Configure job preferences** (role type, salary, location, tech stack)
- [ ] **Complete your profile** (work experience, education, skills)
- [ ] **Review your tech stack** on your profile to ensure accuracy

## What Happens Next?

After enabling Career Mode and completing your setup:

1. **Our system begins matching**: We analyze your profile, preferences, and daily.dev activity to find relevant opportunities
2. **You'll receive notifications**: When a high-quality match is found, you'll see a notification on daily.dev
3. **You stay in control**: You can review opportunities privately and decide whether to express interest
4. **No spam, ever**: You won't receive cold messages from recruiters unless you explicitly approve a job match

## Time Investment

**Initial Setup**: 10-15 minutes to configure preferences and complete your profile

**Ongoing**: No time required. Just check notifications when opportunities arrive.

:::info
The more complete your profile and preferences, the better our matching accuracy. Investing time upfront pays off with higher quality opportunities.
:::

## Privacy First

Remember: Career Mode is **private by default**. Enabling it doesn't make you visible to recruiters. Your information is only shared after you explicitly approve a specific job opportunity.
