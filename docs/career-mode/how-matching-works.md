# How Job Matching Works

Career Mode uses a sophisticated matching system to connect you with opportunities that truly align with your skills, interests, and career goals. Here's how it works.

[See how it works in the app →](https://app.daily.dev/jobs/how-it-works)

## The Matching Process

### 1. Employers Submit Opportunities

Companies post job openings on daily.dev with detailed requirements:

- Role title and seniority level
- Required and preferred technical skills
- Team structure and company culture
- Compensation range
- Location and remote work policies
- Tech stack and tools used

**Important**: These jobs are **not publicly displayed** on daily.dev. They're only visible to matched developers.

### 2. We Analyze Your Profile

Our system evaluates multiple signals to understand your skills, interests, and preferences:

**From your daily.dev activity**:
- Articles you read and engage with
- Tags you follow
- Squads you participate in
- Content you bookmark or share
- Your reading consistency and patterns

**From your Career Mode profile**:
- Work experience and career trajectory
- Education and certifications
- Technical skills and expertise
- Open source contributions
- Side projects and publications

**From your job preferences**:
- Desired role type and scope
- Salary expectations
- Location preferences
- Preferred tech stack
- Employment type preferences

### 3. Intelligent Matching Algorithm

We match opportunities to developers based on:

**Technical fit**:
- Skills match between your background and job requirements
- Experience level alignment (junior, mid, senior, staff, etc.)
- Tech stack overlap with your preferences

**Interest alignment**:
- Content engagement patterns indicating genuine interest
- Preference for certain technologies or domains
- Career direction based on recent activity

**Practical considerations**:
- Salary alignment with expectations
- Location compatibility
- Employment type match
- Availability status (actively looking vs. open if right)

### 4. Quality Over Quantity

Unlike traditional job boards, we prioritize match quality over volume:

- **Selective matching**: We only show opportunities that meet a high confidence threshold
- **No spray-and-pray**: You won't see dozens of loosely-relevant jobs
- **Curated experiences**: Each match is intentionally selected for you

:::tip
You won't receive tons of job matches. Career Mode is designed for quality, not quantity. A few highly relevant opportunities are more valuable than dozens of mediocre ones.

## Daily.dev as Trusted Broker

A key differentiator: **employers don't choose candidates**. We do.

### How Traditional Hiring Works

On most platforms:
1. Employers search for candidates
2. They filter and select who to reach out to
3. Mass outreach to many candidates
4. High volume, low personalization

### How Career Mode Works

With our approach:
1. We analyze both sides: opportunities and developers
2. We match based on sophisticated signals, not just keywords
3. We present opportunities to developers
4. Both parties must opt in before connecting

**Why this matters**: You're not competing in a visible marketplace. Employers can't browse profiles and cherry-pick candidates. We act as the trusted broker, ensuring every match is intentional and high-quality.

## The Double Opt-In System

Career Mode requires mutual interest before any introduction happens:

**Step 1 - Developer approval**:
- You receive a match notification
- You privately review the opportunity
- You decide: interested or not interested

**Step 2 - Employer approval**:
- If you're interested, we share your profile with the employer
- The hiring manager reviews your background
- They decide: proceed with introduction or pass

**Step 3 - Warm introduction**:
- Only if both parties say yes, we facilitate an email introduction
- The conversation moves forward from there
- No ghosting, no wasted time

This double opt-in ensures:
- Both parties are genuinely interested
- Time is respected on both sides
- Higher conversion from introduction to meaningful conversation

## Signals That Improve Matching

Want to receive better matches? These actions strengthen our understanding of your interests:

### High-Impact Signals

1. **Complete your profile**: Work experience, education, and skills give us concrete data
2. **Upload your CV**: Rich historical context about your background
3. **Set clear preferences**: Specific job preferences reduce ambiguity
4. **Configure tech stack**: Explicit technology preferences override assumptions
5. **Update availability**: Indicates urgency and readiness

### Ongoing Signals

1. **Read consistently**: Regular engagement helps us understand evolving interests
2. **Engage authentically**: Upvote, comment, and bookmark content you genuinely care about
3. **Join relevant Squads**: Squad participation shows interest areas
4. **Update your profile**: As you grow, reflect changes in your profile

The matching algorithm continuously learns and improves. The more you engage authentically with daily.dev, the better our matches become.

## What Makes a "Good Match"?

A high-quality match typically has:

- **85%+ technical skills overlap**: Most required skills align with your background
- **Interest validation**: Your reading and engagement patterns support this interest
- **Preference alignment**: Matches your role type, location, and salary expectations
- **Career progression fit**: Represents growth from your current or most recent position
- **Culture and values fit**: Company values align with your demonstrated interests

## When You Don't Receive Matches

Not receiving many matches? This could mean:

**Limited opportunities in your niche**:
- Highly specialized tech stacks have fewer openings
- Very specific location requirements narrow the pool

**Preference constraints**:
- Salary expectations might be above market for your experience level
- Location limitations restrict available roles
- Tech stack preferences might be too narrow

**Profile incompleteness**:
- Missing work experience or skills data
- Unclear job preferences
- No CV uploaded

**What to do**:
1. Review and broaden your job preferences slightly
2. Ensure your profile is complete and up-to-date
3. Upload your CV if you haven't already
4. Verify your tech stack reflects your actual interests
5. Consider expanding location preferences or remote work options

:::tip
If you're open to opportunities but not receiving matches, try incrementally broadening your preferences. Small adjustments can significantly expand the opportunity pool.

## Match Timing

**How often you'll receive matches**: Varies significantly based on:
- Your specialization and skill level
- Market demand in your tech stack
- Number of employers actively hiring on daily.dev
- How selective your preferences are

**Typical patterns**:
- Common stacks (JavaScript, Python, cloud): More frequent opportunities
- Specialized stacks (Elixir, embedded, niche domains): Less frequent but highly relevant
- Senior+ roles: Less frequent but higher quality
- Actively looking: Prioritized for timely opportunities

## Continuous Improvement

Our matching algorithm continuously evolves:

- We learn from match outcomes (acceptances, interviews, hires)
- We refine understanding of what makes a successful match
- We incorporate new signals as Career Mode grows
- We listen to feedback to improve accuracy

The more developers use Career Mode, the smarter it becomes.
