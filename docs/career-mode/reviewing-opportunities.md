## Getting Notified

When a relevant opportunity is matched to your profile, you'll see:

**On daily.dev**:

- Text reading "New opportunity waiting for review" or similar

**Via email** (if notifications are enabled):

Check daily.dev regularly when Career Mode is active. Opportunities don't expire immediately, but employers appreciate timely responses from interested candidates.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Questions to Ask Yourself

**Technical fit**:
- Does the tech stack excite me?
- Are the problems challenging and interesting?
- Will I learn and grow in this role?

**Career progression**:
- Is this a step forward in my career?
- Does the seniority level match my experience?
- Are there growth opportunities?

**Compensation**:
- Is the salary range acceptable?
- Is the total compensation (equity, benefits) fair?
- Does it represent an improvement?

**Work environment**:
- Does the remote policy work for my lifestyle?
- Do I vibe with the company mission and culture?
- Does the team structure appeal to me?

**Practical considerations**:
- Is the timing right for a change?
- Can I commit to the interview process?
- Am I genuinely interested in this opportunity?

### Red Flags to Watch For

While we vet employers, always evaluate opportunities critically:

- Compensation significantly below market
- Vague or unrealistic role descriptions
- Excessive requirements for the seniority level
- Company culture signals that don't align with your values
- Work arrangements that don't match your needs

If something feels off, it's okay to decline.

## After Expressing Interest

If you click "I'm Interested," here's what to expect:

### 1. Employer Review (1-3 business days typically)

The hiring manager receives your:
- Work experience and career history
- Education and certifications
- Skills and technical background
- Open source and project work
- Any other relevant profile information

They evaluate whether there's mutual fit.

### 2. Employer Decision

**If they're interested**:
- We facilitate a warm email introduction
- You receive an introduction email connecting you with the recruiter/hiring manager
- The conversation moves forward from there
- Next steps typically include a screening call or initial interview

**If they pass**:
- You're notified that they've decided not to move forward
- No ghosting—you get a clear response
- You can continue exploring other opportunities

### 3. Moving Forward

Once introduced:
- The hiring process follows the company's standard practice
- Career Mode's active role ends after the introduction
- You engage directly with the employer for interviews and negotiation

:::info
While Career Mode facilitates the introduction, we don't control the employer's hiring process, timeline, or decision-making. We've ensured they're committed to respectful, transparent communication.

## Managing Multiple Opportunities

You can have multiple opportunities in flight simultaneously:

- **Review each independently**: Every opportunity deserves individual consideration
- **Express interest in multiple**: It's okay to explore several options
- **Manage your time**: Be realistic about interview capacity
- **Communicate proactively**: If you accept an offer, withdraw from other processes respectfully

## Best Practices

### Do:
- Read the entire opportunity brief thoroughly
- Take time to evaluate—don't rush
- Express interest only when genuinely interested
- Respond to introductions promptly
- Ask thoughtful questions during interviews
- Be honest about your interests and concerns

### Don't:
- Express interest in everything just to "see what happens"
- Ignore introductions after expressing interest
- Waste employers' time if you're not seriously considering the role
- Forget to update your availability if you accept a position elsewhere
