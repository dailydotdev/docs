# Configuring Job Preferences

Your job preferences are the foundation of Career Mode's matching system. The more detailed your preferences, the more accurate your job matches will be.

## Accessing Job Preferences

1. Click on your **profile picture** in the top right
2. Select **Settings**
3. Navigate to **Job Preferences** in the sidebar

[Open Job Preferences →](https://app.daily.dev/settings/job-preferences)

## Supercharge Your Matches: Upload Documents

The fastest way to improve match quality is by uploading relevant documents. This gives our system rich context about your background and current situation.

### Upload Your CV

**Why it helps**: Your CV contains valuable information about your work history, education, skills, and achievements that helps us understand what opportunities would be the best fit.

**What we extract**:
- Work experience and tenure
- Education and certifications
- Technical skills and expertise
- Career progression patterns

**To upload**:
1. Go to Job Preferences
2. Find the "Supercharge Your Match Quality" section
3. Click **Upload CV**
4. Select your resume file (PDF or DOCX)

:::tip
Keep your CV up to date. When you gain new skills or experiences, upload a fresh version to improve matching accuracy.
:::

### Upload Your Employment Agreement (Optional)

**Why it helps**: Your employment agreement lets us ensure that every opportunity we show you is definitively better than what you currently have.

**What we check**:
- Current compensation
- Benefits and perks
- Work arrangements
- Other terms

**Important**: Your employment agreement is **never shared with anyone**. This document stays completely private between you and daily.dev. We only use it to filter out opportunities that wouldn't represent an upgrade.

:::info Privacy Guarantee
Your employment agreement is stored securely and never shared with employers or recruiters. We use it solely to ensure we only show you opportunities that improve your current situation.

## Describe Your Desired Role

Use this free-text field to describe what you're looking for in your next position. Be as specific or broad as you like.

**What to include**:
- Type of products or problems you want to work on
- Company stage or size preferences
- Team structure preferences
- Technologies you want to work with
- Career growth aspirations

**Example**:
```
Looking for a senior backend role at a fast-growing startup
building developer tools. Interested in distributed systems
and API design. Want to work with a small, autonomous team
where I can have significant architectural influence.
```

## Role Type Preferences

Tell us what kind of role you're seeking:

- **Individual Contributor (IC)**: Hands-on technical roles focused on building and implementing
- **Management**: Leading teams, making architectural decisions, mentoring developers
- **Let us decide**: Open to both IC and management opportunities

## Employment Type

Specify the types of employment you're open to:

- **Full-time**: Traditional full-time employment
- **Contract**: Fixed-term contract positions
- **Freelance**: Project-based freelance work
- **Part-time**: Reduced hour positions

You can select multiple options if you're flexible.

:::tip
Selecting multiple employment types broadens your opportunities. If you're only interested in full-time roles, select only that option.
:::

## Salary Expectations

Setting accurate salary expectations is crucial for both parties:

**Why it matters**:
- Prevents wasting time on opportunities below your threshold
- Ensures employers are prepared for your compensation range
- Increases the likelihood of successful negotiations

**How to set it**:
1. Research market rates for your role and location
2. Consider your current compensation
3. Factor in your experience level
4. Be realistic but don't undersell yourself

:::warning
Setting expectations too high may limit opportunities. Too low may lead to offers below your worth. Research thoroughly and be honest about your market value.
:::

## Location Preferences

Specify where you're willing to work:

### Adding Locations

1. Click **Add Location**
2. Search for and select cities, regions, or countries
3. Add multiple locations if you're flexible

### Remote Work Settings

Indicate your remote work preferences:

- **Fully Remote**: Work from anywhere
- **Hybrid**: Combination of remote and office
- **On-site**: Office-based work
- **Remote with occasional travel**: Mostly remote with periodic in-person meetings

You can specify different remote preferences for different locations.

**Example setup**:
- San Francisco, CA: Hybrid or On-site
- Anywhere in Europe: Fully Remote
- New York, NY: Hybrid

## Preferred Tech Stack

Your tech stack preferences ensure you only see opportunities using technologies you want to work with.

### Two Options to Configure

**1. Copy from Your Profile**

If your daily.dev reading habits already reflect your interests:
- Click **Copy from Profile**
- We'll use the technologies you engage with most

**2. Select Manually**

Choose specific technologies:
1. Click **Add Technology**
2. Search and select languages, frameworks, tools, or platforms
3. Add as many as relevant

**Technologies to include**:
- Programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Rust)
- Frameworks (e.g., React, Django, Next.js)
- Platforms (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL)
- Tools (e.g., Docker, Git, Jenkins)
- Domains (e.g., AI/ML, Security, DevOps)

:::tip
Be thoughtful about your selections. Only include technologies you actively want to use in your next role, not just everything you've ever touched.

## Turning Career Mode On/Off

You can disable Career Mode at any time:

1. Go to Job Preferences
2. Toggle the **Career Mode** switch off

When disabled:
- You won't receive any new job matches
- Existing matches remain accessible
- Your preferences are saved for when you re-enable

## Best Practices

To get the most out of Career Mode:

1. **Be specific but not overly restrictive**: Narrow enough to filter noise, broad enough to see opportunities
2. **Update regularly**: As your preferences evolve, update your settings
3. **Upload documents**: Your CV dramatically improves match accuracy
4. **Be honest about salary**: Don't waste time on mismatched expectations
5. **Review and refine**: If matches aren't quite right, adjust your preferences
