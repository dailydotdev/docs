# Privacy and Trust

Career Mode is built on a foundation of trust and transparency. Your privacy is paramount, and you maintain complete control over your information. Here's exactly how we protect you.

## Private by Default

The most important principle: **Career Mode is private by default**. Enabling Career Mode does not make you visible to employers.

### What This Means

When you enable Career Mode:

- ❌ Employers **cannot** search for your profile
- ❌ Employers **cannot** browse a directory of candidates
- ❌ Employers **cannot** see that you're using Career Mode
- ❌ Recruiters **cannot** send you cold messages
- ✅ You remain completely invisible until you explicitly approve a specific opportunity

**You are in control**. Always.

## The No Spam Promise

Unlike LinkedIn, job boards, or other hiring platforms:

- **No cold outreach**: Recruiters cannot contact you unless you approve their specific job
- **No InMail-style messages**: There's no way for anyone to send you unsolicited career messages
- **No profile visibility**: Your Career Mode profile isn't searchable or browsable

The only way a recruiter can reach you is through the double opt-in process: you approve their job, they approve your profile, and then we make an introduction.

## What Information We Use (Internally)

To match you with opportunities, we analyze:

### Your daily.dev Activity
- Articles you read and engage with
- Tags and topics you follow
- Squads you participate in
- Content you bookmark or share
- Reading patterns and consistency

**Privacy note**: This data is already part of your daily.dev usage. We simply use it to better understand your interests and technical focus.

### Your Career Mode Profile
- Work experience and job history
- Education and certifications
- Skills and technical expertise
- Open source contributions
- Side projects and publications
- Volunteering activities

**Privacy note**: You control what you add to your profile. Only include information you're comfortable sharing with potential employers.

### Your Job Preferences
- Desired role type and scope
- Salary expectations
- Location preferences
- Preferred tech stack
- Employment type preferences
- Availability status

**Privacy note**: These preferences are never shared. We use them only to filter and match opportunities to you.

### Your Documents
- CV/Resume (if uploaded)
- Employment agreement (if uploaded)

**Privacy note**: These documents are stored securely and used only for matching. Your employment agreement is **never shared** with anyone.

## What's Shared With Employers (And When)

Employers only see your information **after you explicitly approve their specific job opportunity**. Here's exactly what happens:

### Before You Approve a Job

**Employers see**: Nothing. They don't know you exist.

**Employers cannot**:
- View your profile
- See your name
- Access your contact information
- Know that you were matched with their job

### After You Approve a Job

**Employers see**:
- Your name
- Your work experience and job history
- Education and certifications
- Skills and technical expertise
- Open source contributions (if included in profile)
- Side projects (if included in profile)
- Publications (if included in profile)
- Volunteering work (if included in profile)

**Employers still cannot see**:
- Your CV document (unless you explicitly choose to send it later)
- Your employment agreement (**never** shared under any circumstances)
- Your job preferences (salary expectations, desired role, etc.)
- Your daily.dev activity or engagement patterns
- Other opportunities you've reviewed or approved

### After Both Parties Approve (Introduction Made)

Once the employer also approves your profile:
- We send a warm email introduction
- Your email address is shared so the conversation can continue
- The hiring process moves to direct communication between you and the employer

:::info
At this stage, what you share is entirely up to you. You control the conversation and can share additional information (like your CV) as you see fit during the interview process.

## Special Protection: Employment Agreement

Your employment agreement receives extra privacy protection:

### What It's Used For
- Understanding your current compensation
- Ensuring opportunities we show you are definitively better
- Filtering out roles that wouldn't represent an upgrade

### What It's NOT Used For
- ❌ Never shared with employers
- ❌ Never used in negotiations
- ❌ Never seen by anyone except our matching system
- ❌ Never used for any purpose other than filtering opportunities

This document exists solely to protect you—ensuring we only show opportunities that improve your current situation.

:::warning
Your employment agreement is treated with the highest level of confidentiality. It's encrypted, securely stored, and never shared under any circumstances.
:::

## Data Security

We take security seriously:

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access controls**: Strict internal access policies limit who can view candidate data
- **Audit logs**: We track all access to sensitive information
- **Regular security reviews**: Ongoing security assessments and updates
- **Compliance**: We adhere to data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## Controlling Your Visibility

You have multiple ways to control your Career Mode visibility:

### Turn Off Career Mode Anytime

1. Go to Settings → Job Preferences
2. Toggle Career Mode off

**Effect**:
- You stop receiving new opportunities
- Your profile is no longer matched with jobs
- Previous opportunities remain accessible
- Your data and preferences are saved

### Update Your Availability

Change between "Actively Looking" and "Open Only If It's Right" to signal urgency:

**Actively Looking**: Prioritized for timely opportunities, faster matching
**Open Only If It's Right**: Lower priority, more selective matching

### Decline Opportunities

Every opportunity can be declined:
- No information is shared with the employer
- No penalty for declining
- Doesn't affect future opportunities

### Delete Your Profile Data

You can delete your Career Mode profile data:

1. Go to Settings → Job Preferences
2. Click "Delete Career Mode Data"
3. Confirm deletion

**Effect**:
- All Career Mode-specific data is permanently deleted
- Work experience, education, etc. removed
- Job preferences reset
- Uploaded documents deleted
- Cannot be undone

Your daily.dev account and regular activity remain unaffected.

## Employer Vetting

We don't let just anyone hire on daily.dev:

### What We Check

Before onboarding employers:
- **Company legitimacy**: Verified real companies with established presence
- **Hiring authority**: Confirmed they have actual open roles and budget
- **Commitment to respect**: Agreement to our standards for candidate communication
- **No spam policy**: Understanding of our double opt-in process

### Ongoing Monitoring

We monitor employer behavior:
- Response rates and timeliness
- Candidate feedback
- Hiring practices and communication quality
- Compliance with Career Mode principles

Poor actors are removed from the platform.

:::tip
If you have a negative experience with an employer after being introduced, please report it. We take employer quality seriously and act on feedback.

1. **Clear communication**: You always know what's being shared and when
