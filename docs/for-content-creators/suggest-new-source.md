# How to suggest a new source

## Introduction

At daily.dev, we collect posts from a lot of unique sources across the web. All of our sources have been added following a request we got from the community. That's an essential part of our community-driven approach. 

We try our best to cover as much quality content as possible. But sometimes, it happens that you like to follow a particular source that's not in our current sources list. We understand that. That's why we have the option to request new sources! 

:::caution
Before you embark on submitting a new source suggestion, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md). These principles are the cornerstone of our content review process and they ensure that our platform maintains its standard of high-quality, relevant, and ethical content. So, take a moment to read through these guidelines thoroughly. Doing so will increase your understanding of what we look for and improve the likelihood of your content being accepted. Your informed contribution can help make our platform an even more enriching resource for our community.

## FAQ

### What happens after my source was approved?

If it gets approved, every new post that is published by this source will be collected by daily.dev, analyzed, and if it is suitable will be added to the feed. It might take a few days until it is fully synced, so please bear that in mind.

### My source got approved, is it permanant? 

The daily.dev community is highly sensitive to content quality and the code of conduct of publishers. After a new source is approved and added to the daily.dev feed, we continue to monitor it continuously. Our aim is simple -- to maintain and enforce the content guidelines for the benefit of our community.‍ ‍We kindly ask you to refrain from misusing the opportunity to be listed on the daily.dev feed as it may lead to disqualification of your approved source.

### My source request got rejected, Can I submit it again?

Basically, yes. But please be mindful and only submit your source again once you've made a substantial change. If you got rejected and you'd like to get additional information please contact us at support@daily.dev

### Where can I see the status of my review process?

Besides the email notifications, there's no way to check the status of your source request review process. Your patience is much appreciated :)
