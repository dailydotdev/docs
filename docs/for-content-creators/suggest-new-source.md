# How to Suggest a New Source on daily.dev

## Introduction

We're delighted you’re interested in adding valuable content to daily.dev. Our platform continuously
grows with community-recommended sources. If you’ve discovered a source that could benefit
daily.dev, but it’s not currently listed, we invite you to suggest it.

:::caution Please review our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md)
before suggesting a new source. These guidelines are essential to our content review process,
ensuring high-quality, relevant, and ethical content. Understanding and following these guidelines
will improve the chances of your suggestion being accepted, helping us make daily.dev an exceptional
resource. :::

### Prerequisites

1. Familiarize yourself with our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md).
2. Register on daily.dev.
3. Ensure your publication has a public RSS feed.
4. Confirm the source is a well-known publication or developer blogging platform.
5. Corporate and personal blogs are not eligible. Consider
   [starting a Squad](../squads/creating-your-squad.md) instead.

:::note Some existing sources may not fully align with our updated criteria. We are gradually
migrating relevant sources to Squads to ensure alignment with current standards. :::

   [browser extension](../getting-started/browser-extension-installation.md) or the

## FAQ

### What Happens After Approval?

added to the feed. Note that historical content is not auto-populated from newly approved sources;
only content published after approval will be considered. Please allow a few days for full
synchronization.

### Is Approval Permanent?

We continuously monitor new sources to maintain content quality. Misuse of the platform may result
in the disqualification of an approved source.

### Can I Resubmit a Rejected Source?

Yes, but only after making significant changes. For further assistance, contact support@daily.dev.
