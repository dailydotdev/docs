# How to Suggest a New Source on daily.dev

## Introduction

We're delighted you’re interested in adding valuable content to daily.dev. Our platform continuously grows with community-recommended sources. If you’ve discovered a source that could benefit daily.dev, but it’s not currently listed, we invite you to suggest it.

:::caution
Please review our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) before suggesting a new source. These guidelines are essential to our content review process, ensuring high-quality, relevant, and ethical content. Understanding and following these guidelines will improve the chances of your suggestion being accepted, helping us make daily.dev an exceptional resource.

### Prerequisites

1. Familiarize yourself with our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md).
2. Register on daily.dev.
3. Ensure your publication has a public RSS feed.
4. Confirm the source is a well-known publication or developer blogging platform.
5. Corporate and personal blogs are not eligible. Consider [starting a Squad](../squads/creating-your-squad.md) instead.

:::note
Some existing sources may not fully align with our updated criteria. We are gradually migrating relevant sources to Squads to ensure alignment with current standards.

We continuously monitor new sources to maintain content quality. Misuse of the platform may result in the disqualification of an approved source.
