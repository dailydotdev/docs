# Content guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to our content guidelines  This page is your comprehensive guide to understanding the core principles and standards that shape the content on our platform. Whether you're a content creator, developer, or enthusiast exploring the wide variety of resources on our platform, these guidelines serve as the blueprint for our commitment to quality, innovation, and ethics. 

In this document, we provide detailed guidance on what we look for in content, what we prioritize, and under what conditions we might remove content. These guidelines are not only a reference for anyone who creates or submits content to daily.dev, but also an insight into our dedication to maintaining a respectful, diverse, and valuable community.

Take a moment, dive in, and let's create an enriching and inspiring space together!

By aligning your content with our standards, you not only enhance the quality of our community but also build your reputation as a trusted source of knowledge.

### What content are we looking for?

✅ Professional and well-written content.

✅ Novel, innovative, and trending content that inspires developers.

✅ Content that adheres to ethical publishing practices.

✅ Content from sources that publish new content regularly.

✅ Content that clearly separates sponsored content, if any, from editorial content.

✅ Good vibes ✌️

:::info
In our ongoing effort to maintain a balanced content inventory on the platform, we are temporarily giving higher priority to niche sources during our review process. This allows us to provide our developer community with a diverse range of topics and unique perspectives. As a result, we may apply more strict judgment on mainstream content. This is to ensure that our platform maintains a healthy mix of content and caters to various interests within the global developer community.

### When will we reject, ban or remove content?

❌ Content that is irrelevant for developers.

### Additional guidelines for corporate blogs

In addition to the general guidelines above, corporate blogs that wish to pass the review process should also consider the following specific guidelines:

✅ Content from a dedicated RSS feed that is free of promotional material or company updates such as press releases, customer use cases, funding announcements, product updates, or any similar content.

### Additional guidelines for personal blogs

At the moment, the basic rule of thumb in our review process is that we do not approve personal blogs as sources. However, we recently started working gradually towards allowing personal blogs on the platform. During this interim period, we will only approve personal blogs that meet specific criteria. If you're submitting a personal blog for review, please ensure it meets the following guidelines:

✅ Personal blog of a global thought leader who has a significant impact on the developer community.

✅ Focused on niche topics that cater to specific and non-mainstream interests.

Please note that these additional guidelines for personal blogs are subject to change as we continue to refine our review process.
