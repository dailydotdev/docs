### Additional Guidelines for Corporate Blogs

[Update January 2024] Corporate blogs are no longer eligible as sources on daily.dev. We encourage corporations to [open a Squad](../squads/creating-your-squad.md) on our platform instead. We will gradually migrate existing corporate blogs to Squads to adhere to these guidelines.

[Update January 2024] Personal blogs are no longer eligible to be added as sources on daily.dev. Instead, personal bloggers and content creators are encouraged to [create a Squad](../squads/creating-your-squad.md) to share content with our community. We’ll transition existing personal blogs to Squads gradually.

### Update Regarding AI-Generated Content

At daily.dev, we emphasize human insight, expertise, and lived experiences in content creation. We value the unique perspectives and nuanced understanding human authors bring, which strengthens the authenticity and quality of information on our platform. AI-generated content, while advancing in quality, doesn’t meet our standard for human insight, and we prioritize human-created content to maintain genuine engagement.

We appreciate your understanding and adherence to this policy.
