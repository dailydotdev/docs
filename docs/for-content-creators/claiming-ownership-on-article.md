### Gain Reputation Points and Build Your Profile

As mentioned in our previous announcements, here’s a quick reminder about [What is reputation? How do I earn it?](../your-profile/reputation.md)

We’ve redesigned the profile to feature a special section for your posts. For every upvote your post earns, you’ll receive a +1 reputation point, which helps build your reputation on daily.dev.
