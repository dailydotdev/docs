## Post Ownership Verification Process

Claim ownership of your technical content to unlock creator features and build your professional developer profile.

:::info
**Eligibility requirement**: Only posts already featured in the daily.dev feed can be claimed. Verify your content appears by [searching its headline](https://app.daily.dev/search) first.
:::

### Technical Setup Requirements

**Step 1: HTML Meta Tag Configuration**
Add the Twitter creator meta tag to your blog post's HTML `<head>` section:

```html
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@yourusername" />
```

**Implementation Notes**
- Replace `@yourusername` with your actual Twitter/X handle
- Ensure the tag is in the HTML `<head>` section, not the `<body>`
- Most blogging platforms (WordPress, Ghost, Hashnode) support this in SEO settings
- The tag must be present when daily.dev crawls your content

### Account Configuration

**Step 2: Daily.dev Profile Setup**
1. **Navigate to your daily.dev profile** by clicking your avatar
2. **Open Account Details** from the dropdown menu  
3. **Locate social connections** in your profile settings
4. **Add your Twitter handle** exactly as specified in the meta tag
5. **Save your profile changes** to update your social connections

:::tip
**Consistency is key**: Your Twitter handle in the meta tag and daily.dev profile must match exactly, including the @ symbol format.
:::

### Retroactive Ownership Claims

**Step 3: Historical Content Claims**
For posts published before setting up ownership verification:

**Contact Support for Retroactive Claims**
