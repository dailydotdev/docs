## Why should you claim ownership of a post you wrote?

### Get notified when your post got listed by daily.dev

At the end of the day, we all write for a particular audience. Engaging with your readers in real-time can make the difference between a memorable post and a forgotten one. Even more, getting notified in real-time will enable you to encourage a meaningful discussion about the blog post you wrote. That way, you can increase your readership and create a long-lasting relationship with your audience.
